# This file was created by "oasis setup". You may modify this file freely.
# It is not overwritten once it exists. The same holds for OMakeroot and
# all OMakefiles in the subdirectories. The files following the naming
# pattern _oasis_*.om are overwritten by the next "oasis setup".

# Include OASIS library:

if $(not $(file-exists _oasis_lib.om))
    err. =
        extends $(Exception)
        message = $'Not set up. Run first: oasis setup'
    raise $(err)

if $(not $(file-exists setup.data))
    err. =
        extends $(Exception)
        message = $'Not configured. Run first: ocaml setup.ml -configure'
    raise $(err)

include _oasis_lib.om

# Include the configuration, i.e. the output of "ocaml setup.ml -configure".
# The settings are written to a file setup.data. We need it in a different
# format, and convert the setup here. Note that the variables from setup.data
# are prefixed with "oasis_", e.g. "prefix" is made available as
# $(oasis_prefix). At this point we also initialize a number of build-related
# variables like BYTE_ENANBLED or OCAMLFLAGS.

.INCLUDE: _oasis_setup.om: setup.data
    OASIS_generate_setup()

# At this point you may fine-tune the configuration, and modify defaults:
#
# OCAML_LIB_MODULE_SUFFIXES += .ml       (install also .ml files with libs)
# OCAMLFINDFLAGS += -verbose             (be verbose)
# OCAMLFLAGS += -bin-annot               (create .cmt/.cmti files)

OCAMLFLAGS_ANNOT = -annot -bin-annot

#   .SUBDIRS: _build/src _build/lib _build/lib_test _build/plugins

# Until this point we allow to override variables via the command-line.
# That means all initializations from above can be changed by omake arguments
# here. E.g. invoke with "omake BYTE_ENABLED=false" to disable bytecode
# builds.

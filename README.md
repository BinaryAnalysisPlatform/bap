# Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap)

`Bap` library provides basic facilities for performing binary analysis in OCaml.

## Installing `bap` dependencies

The easiest way to install the OCaml dependencies of `bap` is to use
the `opam` package manager:

```bash
$ opam install bitstring core_kernel zarith
```

_Note:_ The most up-to-date source of our dependency list is in our travis
automation script `.travis-ci.sh`. The variable `SYS_DEPENDS` lists dependencies
that should be installed on your system using `apt-get`; the variable
`OPAM_DEPENDS` lists dependencies that can be installed via `opam`.

If you would like to use our serialization library, then please also install the
`piqi` package as follows:

```bash
$ opam install piqi
```

If you are using a development version, e.g., you have just cloned this from
github, then you will also need the `oasis` package in order to create a build
environment.

```bash
$ opam install oasis
```

We also recommend you install `utop` for running BAP.

```bash
$ opam install utop
```

Finally, you need to now install LLVM.  LLVM often changes their APIs,
so we have had to standardize against one.  BAP currently compiles
against llvm-3.4, which we have confirmed works on OSX and Ubuntu.

## Compiling and installing `bap`

Once all the dependencies of `bap` have been installed, we can start the actual
build. Now, run the following commands:

```bash
$ make
$ make install
```

This will run take care to run all configuration scripts for you. If
you want to provide some specific flags to `configure`, then you need
either to invoke it manually with `./configure` or provide them to
make using `BAPCONFIGUREFLAGS` environment variable.

Note: if you have chosen prefix that require super-user privileges,
then you need to run `make install` using either `sudo`, e.g., `sudo
make install` or switch to a super-user mode. Although it is not
required, we suggest to install `bap` in to `opam` stack. In this case
a proper prefix can be generated using `opam config var` command,
e.g.,

```bash
./configure --prefix=$(opam config var prefix)
```

If you have installed `bap` previously, then use the command `make reinstall`
instead of `make install`. However, this will *not* work if `setup.log` has been
erased (by, for example, `git clean -fdx` or `make clean`). In that case, you
can remove the old `bap` installation manually via the command `ocamlfind remove
bap`.

# Usage

## Using from top-level

It is a good idea to learn how to use our library by playing in an OCaml
top-level. If you have installed `utop`, then you can just use our `baptop`
script to run `utop` with `bap` extensions:

```bash
$ baptop
```

Now, you can play with BAP. For example:

```ocaml
utop # open Bap.Std;;
utop # let x = Word.of_int32 0xDEADBEEFl;;
val x : word = 0xDEADBEEF:32
utop # let y = Word.of_int32 0xEFBEADDEl;;
val y : word = 0xEFBEADDE:32
utop # let z = Word.Int.(!$x + !$y);;
val z : Word.Int.t = Core_kernel.Result.Ok 0xCE6C6CCD:32
utop # let z = Word.Int_exn.(x + y);;
val z : word = 0xCE6C6CCD:32
utop # Word.to_bytes x BigEndian |> Sequence.to_list;;
- : word list = [0xDE:8; 0xAD:8; 0xBE:8; 0xEF:8]
```

If you do not want to use `baptop` or `utop`, then you can execute the following
in any OCaml top-level:

```ocaml
# #use "topfind";;
# #require "bap.top";;
# open Bap.Std;;
```

And everything should work just out of box, i.e. it will load all the
dependencies, install top-level printers, etc.

## Compiling your program with `bap`

Similar to the top-level, you can use our `bapbuild` script to compile a program
that uses `bap` without tackling with the build system. For example, if your
program is `mycoolprog.ml`, then you can execute:

```bash
$ bapbuild mycoolprog.native
```

and you will obtain `mycoolprog.native`. If `bapbuild` complains that something
is missing, make sure that you didn't skip the [Installation](#Installation)
phase. You can add your own dependencies with a `-package` command line option.

If you use your own build environment, please make sure that you have added
`bap` as a dependency. We install our libraries using `ocamlfind` and you just
need to add `bap` to your project. For example, if you use `oasis`, then you
should add `bap` to the `BuildDepends` field. If you are using `ocamlbuild` with
the `ocamlfind` plugin, then you should add `package(bap)` or `pkg_bap` to your
`_tags` file.

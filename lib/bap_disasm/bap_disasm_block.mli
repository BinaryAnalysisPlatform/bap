(** {4 Navigating blocks structure}

    The following functions allows you to navigate through blocks
    without explicitly using graphs. Each neighborhood function
    returns closest neighbors as a lazy sequence. Please, be cautious,
    since this can contain loops, i.e. block can contain itself as a
    predecessor.

    You can use [Block.compare] or [compare_block] functions, to safely
    compare blocks with each other, without a risk of non-termination.

    Note, the sequence is not guaranteed to be contigious, instructions
    that wasn't decoded will be skipped.

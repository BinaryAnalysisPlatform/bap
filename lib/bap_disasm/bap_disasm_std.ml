(** {4 Expert interface to disassembler}
    This interface is rather complicated, and is built around to
    implementations of the disassembler [Basic] and [Recursive].
    [Basic] provides an efficient (and very lazy) linear sweep,
    driven in a continuation passing style. On top of the [Basic]
    the [Recursive] disassembler is built, that reconstructs the
    control flow graph, and represents the latter as a table of
    blocks. *)

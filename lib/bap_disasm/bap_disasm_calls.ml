(** Set of node parents.


    A node [n] is a parent of node [m] iff [n <> m /\ n <> Entry] and
    if every path from the [entry] node to [m] contains [n]. In other
    words, if it [n] strictly dominates [m] and is not the entry node.

    We compute parents using descending fixed point computation, with
    lattice of subsets. In our representation we use [Top] to denote the
    set of all nodes, and [Set xs] to denote a set of known nodes.

    The merge (meet) operator is the set intersection. The transfer
    function is defined as
    {v
      transfer Entry ps = ps
      transfer node Top = Top
      transfer node ps = (node) U ps
    v}

    Usually, dominators are computed using a transfer function that is
    defined as [transfer node ps = (node) U ps], which our third node,
    however we specialized our tranfer function for two reasons

    1) efficiency - the first clause removes an explicit entry node,
    which by dominates all nodes. So we can save some space, as well
    as implement the [is_root] as little bit more efficient.

    2) robustness - usually, the dominators are computed for graphs
    where all nodes are dominated by the entry node. However, our case
    is not general, and we have components which are not reachable
    from the entry node. We do not want such componenets to change the
    parent propery of any node, since there is no path from the [entry]
    node to any other node, that will contain a node from an
    unconnected component.

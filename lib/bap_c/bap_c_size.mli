val padding : Size.t -> int -> int

(** The base class for computing sizes and aligments of C data types.

    The algorithm is implemented as a class to allow
    a particular implementation to fine tune the calculation.

    The [model] argument defines the default sizes for integral data
    types. If no suitable model is available for your architecture
    then use the closest model and override the specific methods to
    fine-tune the data model of your target.

    The entry methods are [bits] and [aligment].

    {3 Example}

    For example, let's compute the size of the

    {v
      struct foo {
         char v1;
         int  v2;
         char v3;
      };
    v}

    Using the LP64 data model, in which integers are 32 bit long and
    char is 8 bit. The size of the structure is 12 bytes, due to
    the 3 bytes of padding before [v2] and six bytes of trailing
    padding.

    {[
      # let size = new C.Size.base `LP64;;
      # size#bits C.Type.(structure "foo" [
          "v1", basic `char;
          "v2", basic `uint;
          "v3", basic `char
        ]);;

        For incomplete types returns [None]. The size is always a
        multitude of the data type alignment and includes the
        paddings necessary for preserving the alignment restrictions.

        @since 2.5.0 the size is a multitude of the alignment.

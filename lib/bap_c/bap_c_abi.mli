    an abstraction of data, that is passed via the parameter,
    and a BIL expression, that denotes the parameter.*)
type param = Bap_c_data.t * exp

(** subroutine argument list is split into three parts:
    [return] is the return arguments, that is optional;
    [params] are regular positional parameters, the length
    of the [params] list must equal to the amount of the
    formals in the function prototype;
    [hidden] are hidden parameters, that are inserted by abi
    to pass special arguments, like [this] pointer or a pointer
    to a structural value, for example.

    The api processor, created by this module, will insert arg terms
    into sub in the following way:

    - nth positional argument corresponds to nth arg term (counting
      from 0).
    - the last arg term corresponds to the return argument, if any;
    - all hidden arguments are put between the last positional and the
      return argument.*)

(** [create_api_processor size t] packs an api processor. The

    propagate some known C attributes into corresponding BIR
    attributes, annotate each inserted arg term with its corresponding
    C type and datum model, and annotate each regognized subroutine
    with its C prototype.

    The api processor relies on an availability of a front end parser
    for C language.*)

(** [arg_intent t] infers argument intention based on its C type.  If
    an argument is passed by value, i.e., it is a c basic type, then
    it is an input argument. If an argument is a reference, but not a
    function, then it is input/output if any value, referenced by the
    argument is non-const. A reference to function always has the
    input intent. If an argyment is a structure or union, then it is
    input/output if any of its fields is input/output.

end


(** A monadic eDSL for argument passing semantics specification.

    This DSL helps in defining the abi processor's [insert_args]
    function. The DSL describes the semantics of argument passing that
    is then reified to the [args] structure. The [DSL] is a choice
    monad that enables describing the argument passing grammar using
    backtracking when the chosen strategy doesn't fit. The [reject ()]
    operator will reject the current computation up until the nearest
    choice prompt, e.g., in the following example, computations [e1],
    [e2], and [e3] are rejected and any side-effects that they might
    had are ignored and, instead the [option2] computation is tried
    as if the previous sequence had never happend.

    {[
      choice [
        sequence [e1; e2; e3; reject ()];
        option2;
      ]
    ]}

    Since the purpose of this DSL is to describe how the passed
    arguments are read in terms of BIL expressions, the generated
    specification could be seen as a grammar and the DSL itself as
    a parser combinator, specialized for describing ABI.

    {2 Example}

    Below we define the semantics of [riscv32] and [riscv64] targets.
    Both targets have fully specified register files with properly
    assigned roles and the register order matches with register names
    ordering, so we can use the simplified Arena creating functions.
    We have four independent arenas, two for passing in and out integer
    arguments, and two corresponding arenas for floating-point
    arguments.

    We start with defining the integer calling convention by first
    determining how many register are needed to pass an argument.
    If the size of the argument couldn't be determined we reject the
    computation. Otherwise, if it fits into one register we try to
    pass it via a register fallback to memory if there are no
    registers available. If it requires two registers we first try to
    pass it as an aligned register pair (with the first part going
    through the nearest available even register). If we don't have
    enough aligned registers, we then split it in two parts and pass
    the first part in a register and the second part in the memory.
    Finally, if the size is greater than two words we pass it as an
    implicit reference.

    The floating-point calling convention assumes the presence of the
    hardware floating-point registers but the specification is general
    enough to handle the soft floats convention, as any attempt to
    pass an argument via the hardware floating-point registers will be
    rejected since the corresponding arena will be empty.

    The convention tries to pass a floating-point argument via the
    corresponding register file if it fits into a register otherwise
    it falls back to the integer registers. When an argument fits into
    the floating-point register we first try passing it through the
    floating-point file and if it is out of registers we use available
    integer registers (in riscv with hardware floating-point registers
    it is possible to pass 16 floating-point arguments all in
    registers) and finally use the last resort option of using the memory.

      describes the semantics of passing of the return value,
      and the second section describes the semantics of passing the
      list of arguments.

      The semantics is defined as a sequence of these two rules,

      of [t] can't be determined.

      Registers in an arena are enumerated from zero in the order of
      their appearence in the arena specification. This function
      removes, when necessary, a register form the arena, so that the
      next available register has an even number.

      The computation is rejected if there are no more even registers
      in [arena].

      to [t] via the first available register in [arena].

      Rejects the computation if there are no available registers in
      [arena] or if the target doesn't have a register with the stack
      pointer role. The size of [t] is not required. *)
  val reference : arena -> ctype -> unit t

  (** [memory t] passes the argument of type [t] in the next
      available stack slot.

      Rejects the computation if the size of [t] is not known or
      if the target doesn't have a register with the stack pointer
      role.

      The address of the slot is aligned corresponding to the
      alignment requirements of [t] but no less than the
      minimal data alignment requirements of the architecture or
      the natural alignment of the stack pointer.

      Note, passing a number arguments via a descending stack using
      [memory] will pass the arguments in the right-to-left (RTL aka
      C) order, i.e., the first passed argument will end up at the
      bottom (will have the minimal address). Use [push] if you want
      the left-to-right order.

  *)
  val memory : ctype -> unit t


  (** [split_with_memory arena t] passes the low order part of the
      value in a register (if available) and the rest in the memory.

      The size of the part that is passed via the registers is equal
      to the size of the register. The part that is passed via the
      stack is aligned to the stack boundary.

      Rejects the computation if the size of [t] is not known; if
      [arena] is empty; or if some other argument is already passed
      via memory.

  (** [push t] pushes the argument of type [t] via stack.

      Rejects the computation if the size of [t] is not known.

      The address of the slot is aligned corresponding to the
      alignment requirements of [t] but no less than the
      minimal data alignment requirements of the architecture or
      the natural alignment of the stack pointer.

      When passing a number of arguments via a descending stack, the
      last pushed argument will be at the bottom of the stack, i.e.,
      will have the minimal address. This corresponds to the LTR aka
      Pascal ordering.

  (** [either option1 option2] tries to pass using [option1] and
      if it is rejected uses [option2].

      For example, [either (register x) (memory x)] tries to pass
      [x] via a register and if it is not possible (either because
      [x] doesn't fit into a register or there are no registers
      available) tries to pass it via memory.

      If the spec is not rejected the returned structure will contain

  (** An ordered collection of registers.

      Arena is an expendable collection of registers that is used to
      pass arguments. Passing an argument via the register consumes
      it so it is no longer available in the same computation.

      If a computation that used a register is later rejected then the
      register is available again (the same as with any other
      side-effects of a rejected compuation).

      The order of registers in arena, as well as their numbering
      according to that order, usually matters. Many targets have
      registers with the alphabetic orders of registers matching
      their arena orders (with notable exception of x86) that enables
      the direct usage of the [Theory.Target.regs] function to create
      arenas.

(** Taint Analysis Framework.

    Taint analysis is a dynamic data flow analysis, that tracks values
    on demand, i.e., the engine doesn't track all values, but only
    those that are marked as tainted.

    In general, we say that a computation is tainted by an object, if
    its value is dependent (or somehow influenced) on the value of that
    object. However, the precise definition depends on the taint policy
    that is pluggabe and customizable. Some taint policies might be
    more relaxed, than others.

    Traditionally, we use the word "taint" to represent an abstract
    entity whose influence we consider as undesirable or unsafe. Thus a
    computation is tainted, if it depends on a program runtime
    representation of that entity. An actual application of the
    framework may, of course, bend the notion of taint, and instead of
    attaching a negative connotation, treat it in a positive way thus
    checking for the liveness property instead of the safety property.

    In the framework a taint represents an object of some kind, that
    we would like to track, i.e., we would like to know which values
    are affected by the value of that object, which program terms
    compute those values, etc. The engine can track several such
    objects at the same time and can distinguish objects of different
    kinds as well objects of the same kind. In other words a particular
    computation could be tainted by several taints, that
    correspondingly could have different kinds.  To make it easier to
    understand let's take a classical taint analysis example with SQL
    sanitization. We would like to track all objects that were produced
    by sources that we do not trust. These objects are abstract to the
    framework and are introduced arbitrary by the analysis. For
    example, suppose there exists several calls to [recv], and our
    analysis introduces a taint on each call to [recv], that it
    designates with the [unescaped-query] kind. Every call to [recv]
    will create a new object that will belong to the same kind. Now,
    let's assume that our analysis designates the [sql_escape] function
    as a function that negates the untrustworthy effect of the input,
    and essentially clears the taint, or sanitizes it in our
    parlance. A value passed to the [sql_escape] function may have
    several taints attached to it. Some of those taints may be
    irrelevant to the [unescaped-query] kind, i.e., attached by other
    analysis. Since the query could be built from multiple calls to
    recv, there could be more than one taints of the [unescaped-query]
    kind attached to the value. So our analysis will clear all taints
    of the specified kind. Finally, when the privileged location is
    reached, e.g., the [sql_exec] function is called, we check that
    values passed to that function doesn't have any taints of the
    specified kind.

    Other than classical approaches to taint analysis, decribed above,
    the framework could be used for checking liveness properties,
    lifetime analysis, and other analysis that requires tracking the
    flow of information.

        between different analyses so that several analyses could be
        ran in parallel without intersecting with each other.

        e.g., a byte, a bit, or a machine word, that can be somehow
        related to the actual object that we track.

        There could be different kinds of relations, denoted with
        different values of this abstract type. So far, we distinguish
        between the [direct] and [indirect] relation.

        This interface is machine specific, and thus is a functor. It

        (** {3 The low-level interface}

            The low-level interface defines three primitives in terms of
            which we can express a more convenient high-level
            interface. It is recommened to get acquainted with these
            three primitives, to understand how the tracker works,
            however it is better to use the high level interface,
            whenever it is possible.

            To denote the concrete semantics of these primitives we will
            use the taint ternary relation [T] that establishes a
            relation between a value and an object, e.g., [T(v,r,x)] is
            the relation [r] between the value [v] and an object [x].

            Conceptually, the state of the tracker can be seen as a set
            of such relations. Since tracker operations may affect this set
            of relations we will denote relations that existed just
            before an operation with [pre], e.g., [pre(T(v,r,x)] means
            that before the operation there was the relation [T(v,r,x)]

        Although taints could be attached and detached in an arbitrary

        taint propagation.

        By associating a taint propagation policy with an object kind,
        we can specify taint propagation rules based on the kind of
        the object.

        The policy mechanism establishes a surjection of the set of
        object kinds onto the set of policies, that establishes a
        partitioning of all objects into a disjoit set of classes,
        with each class defining its own rules of taint propagation.

          the latter it is [false].

          The event may occur during the GC collection cycle and there

          made. *)

      (** Conservative Garbage Collector.

          The conservative garbage collector may keep taints alive
          even when they become unreachable. This is an
          over-approximation and it is possible to devise a more precise
          GC, especially if soundness is not required (or not strictly
          required).

          Taint is live if either of the following is true:
          1. it is attached to a value of a variable in [Env.all];
          2. it is attached to any address.

          The second clause gives a possibility for
          over-approximation, as we do not track, whether an address
          is reachable from the current program location. So once a
          tainted value is stored and the taint is attached to an
          address, the only way to kill this taint, is to overwrite it
          with another value using another store operation.

          Currently, the garbage collection runs every basic block,
          but this may change in future.

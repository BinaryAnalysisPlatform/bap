  (** Program Bundle.

      Bundle is a collection of data associated with a program. To
      access the bundle, use the {!main_bundle} function, e.g.,

      {[
        open Bap_bundle.Std

        let bundle = main_bundle ()
      ]}

        Extracts a file specified by a [uri] from a [bundle] and returns
        a uri pointing to the extracted file, if was found. The
        optional parameter [name] allows to specify the desired
        filename for the extraction.  *)

        The [spec] is a list of pairs, where the first constituent of

        second constituent is the uri of the file, that should be
        inserted. If the first element of the pair is [None], then the
        file will be inserted under the same path, as it was in the
        file system.
    *)
    val insert_files : t -> (string option * Uri.t) list -> unit


    (** [insert_file ?name bundle uri] insert a file specified by the

    (** [update bundle ~f:action] add, remove or update data in the
        bundle.

        This is a swiss-knife function, that can do arbitrary bundle
        modification. See {!get_file}, {!get_data}, {!insert_files},
        {!insert_file} and {!insert_data} for an easier to use
        interface.


        The [action] function is called on each path,
        and must return one of the following:

        - [`Drop] - to remove the path from the bundle;
        - [`Copy] - to keep it untouched;
        - [`Proc f] - extract it, process the file with a function
                      [f], and put back, where function [f] accepts
                      a temporary name of extracted file;
        - [`Map f] - map the contents of the file with function [f].

        Warning. Modification of a bundle, associated with an
        installed plugin or application will lead to an undefined
        behavior. The function is intended for building a new
        bundle. Once it is created it may be sealed and made
        readonly.*)

    (** Incremental bundle builder.

        Using this module it is possible to build bundle
        recipe incrementally. The data, that was added to
        the bundle will not be copied until the [flush] method is
        called. *)

      val put_file : ?name:string -> t -> Uri.t -> unit


      (** [put_data builder ~name ~data] insert [data] at path
          [name].  *)

  (** Plugin loader.

      This module handles the set of plugins, visible to the
      platform.

      Plugins are looked at the following locations:
      - paths explicitly specified by a user (via [library]
        parameter);
      - paths specified by the [BAP_PLUGIN_PATH] environment
        variable (same syntax as PATH variable);
      - $prefix/lib/bap, where $prefix is the installation prefix,
        specified during the installation.

      The latter destination is used by the [bapbundle install]
      command, so this is the default repository of plugins.

      The plugin loader is an event driven system. Once, [Plugins.run]
      function is called, events of type [Plugins.events] will start
      to fire. By default they are intercepted by a logger, and by the
      default handler (see {!Plugins.run} function description about
      the default handler). The logger will write the information
      about events, that is useful for debugging issues with plugins.

    (** [path] is the default directory where plugins are stored.  *)
    val path : string

    (** [list ()] is a list of available plugins.

        Returns all plugins that provide features specified by
        [provides] and meet the constraint specified by [env]. If a
        non-valid plugin is found in the search path, then it is
        ignored.

        @param provides if specified then only those plugins that
        provide at least one feature from the specified list are
        selected. Otherwise, all plugins are selected.

        @param env is a set of features provided by the runtime
        (defaults to none). If specified, then all plugins that require
        a set of features that is a subset of [env] will be
        selected. Note, usually, plugins do not have any requirements
        (i.e., the have an empty set of requirements), therefore all
        are selected.

        @param library is the list of additional directories in which
        plugins are searched. If specified then it is prepended to the
        default search path that contains (in that order):
        - the list of paths specified by the BAP_PLUGIN_PATH
          environment variable;
        - the [Plugins.directory] constant.

         Note, any non-files or non-directories are silently excluded from
         the list.

    (** [run ()] loads all plugins.

        This command will load all plugins available in the system
        (see the {!load} and {!list} functions for more information on
        which plugins are available). If an error occurs during an
        attempt to load a plugin and if [don't_setup_handlers] option
        is not set to [true], an extended error message is printed to
        the standard error channel and the currently running program is
        terminated with exit code 1.

        This function calls the [load] function and then observes
        (unless [don't_setup_handlers] is set) events that occur
        during loading to intercept any errors. So see the {!load}
        function for more detailed information.

        @param don't_setup_handlers if set to [true] (defaults to
        [false]) then all erros are silently ignored. Don't use it
        unless you're implementing your own error handling facility
        via the event subsystem.*)

    (** [load ()] loads all plugins if they are not loaded yet.

        Loads all plugins available in the system and returns a list
        of values in which each entry corresponds to a result of a
        loading attempt, which could be either a successfully loaded
        plugin or an error, in case if the attempt has failed.

        The list of all plugins is [list ?env ?provides ?library ()]
        which is furthermore refined by removing all plugins which
        names are specified in the [exclude] blacklist.

        This function returns silently if [Plugins.loaded] is already
        decided. No matter the outcome, the [Plugins.loaded] future
        will be decided.

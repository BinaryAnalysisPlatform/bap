(** BAP Semantics Representation.

    {1 A Gentle Introduction to the Core Theory}

    The Core Theory is an intermediate language that is designed to
    express the semantics of computer programs. It focuses on programs
    that are represented in binary machine code and is capable of an
    accurate representation of the architectural and micro-architectural
    details of the program behavior.

    The language is extensible. It is possible to add new language
    features, without affecting existing analyses and even
    without recompilation. Adding new analyses also doesn't require
    any changes to the existing code, which also could be reused
    without recompilation. Thus the language doesn't suffer from the
    expression problem.

    The language is rigidly typed with types expressed as OCaml
    types. A type of a Core Theory term is inferred (and checked) by
    the OCaml type system, which can statically ascertain that the
    term is not ill-formed and no analysis will get stuck.

    The language is adaptable. Analysts can select a designated
    subset of the language which is relevant to their tasks without
    getting bogged down by the irrelevant architectural details.

    The language can express the semantics of the floating point
    operations including operations, but not limiting to, specified in
    the IEEE754 standard.

    The language facilitates developing custom intermediate
    representation and languages, which could be seamlessly introduced
    in the analysis pipeline without breaking existing components. The
    new language is compatible with BIL, BIR, and older variants of
    BIL. It is potentially compatible with any other intermediate
    representations.


    {2 The Language Hierarchy}

    The Core Theory is not really a language but a family of
    languages. If we will order the languages in this family by
    subsumption, then we will get the following Hasse diagram:

    {v

                             o Core
                             |
              Trans o--------+--------o Float
                             |        |
                             o Basic  o FBasic
                             |
                             o Minimal
                             |
            +-------+--------+--------+-------+
            |       |        |        |       |
            o       o        o        o       o
          Init    Bool     Bitv    Memory   Effect

    v}

    The Core language subsumes all other sub-languages and includes
    modular arithmetic and other operations on bitvectos, operations
    with memories, registers, floating points including
    transcendental functions.

    The reason to have so many languages is purely pragmatic: to
    enable specialized implementations of analyses and lifters. This
    structure is not really mandated, the languages are defined
    structurally, not nominally, so it is possible to combine
    languages in arbitrary ways, as well as define new languages.

    The Core language, despite being at the top of our hierarchy, is
    still very low-level and basic. It is intended to reflect
    operations carried by classical computers with Harvard or
    Princeton architectures. Therefore we chose the name "Core" to
    reflect our vision of the Core language as the base for
    higher-level hierarchies of languages.


    {2 Hierarchy of Terms}

    Terms and operations of the Core Theory languages are typed to
    prevent the creation of ill-formed programs. We use the word sort
    to denote a set of terms that share the same properties. The Core
    Theory comes with a collection of predefined sorts, which are used
    to specify the Core language, but it is possible to define new
    sorts, to keep the theory extensible.

    The terms of the Core Theory are divided in two classes - values
    and effects. A value term denotes the semantics of programs that
    produce values. Roughly, values correspond to the syntactic class of
    language expressions.

    Effects is a class of terms that do not produce values, but side
    effects or just effects, e.g., changing a value of a register,
    loading or storing memory location, performing I/O operation on a
    port or issuing a synchronization barrier, etc. Roughly, effects
    correspond to the syntactic class of language statements.

    Both values and effects are knowledge classes. Each class is
    further subdivided into an infinite set of sorts. The class of
    values is inhabited with terms of Bool, Bitv, Mem, Float, and
    Rmode. Some sorts are indexed, so they represent an (infinite)
    family of sorts. For example, Bitv[s] is a family of bitvector sorts
    indexed by their widths, e.g, Bitv[8], Bitv[32], etc.

    The class of effects is subdivided into two sorts of effect, those
    that affect the control flow and those that affect the data flow.


    {v
                              Term
                                o
                                |
                         +------+------+
                         |             |
                   Value o             o Effect
                         |             |
                 Bool o--+         +---+---+
                         |         |       |
              Bitv[s] o--+         o       o
                         |      Ctrl[i]  Data[i]
             Mem[k,s] o--+
                         |
           Float[f,s] o--+
                         |
                Rmode o--+


    v}


    {2:vars Variables}

    Variables are ubiquitous in programming languages and could be
    used to reference memory locations, CPU registers, or just
    be bound to expressions. Sometimes variables are typed, sometimes
    they are just identifiers with not associated type.

    In the Core Theory all variables are sorted, i.e., the have an
    associated value sort. Variables are also having scope and
    extent. Finally, variables could be mutable or immutable.

    A physical variable is a global mutable variable with infinite
    scope and extent. They are used to refer predefined (micro)
    architectural locations of a modeled system, e.g., registers,
    memory banks, caches, register files, etc. Global variables has
    identifiers that are the same as names, e.g., `RAX`, `R0`, `mem`,
    etc. The important thing, is that a global variable usually has
    some physical representation.

    Virtual variables are dual to physical variables and are further
    subdivided into mutable and immutable.

    A mutable virtual variable represents an unspecified scratch
    location that holds data of the specified sort. They could be used
    to abstract an actual physical location in a modeled system (when
    it is not relevant or just not known) or just to simplify the
    analysis. The mutable virtual variables have identifier of the
    form [#<number>], e.g, [#1], [#2048], etc.

    Finally, an immutable virtual variable is a local variable that
    holds a value of an expression. It has a limited scope and its
    immutability is ensured by the type system since the scope of a
    local binding can contain only pure terms, i.e., no
    side-effects. These variables have identifiers of the form
    [$<number>], e.g., [$1], [$2], etc, and since their scope is
    limited, those identifiers are reused in different scopes.


    {2 Theories and Semantics}

    Languages of the Core Theory, including the Core itself are
    represented as module signatures, i.e., they are pure abstractions
    or interfaces that do not define any data types, functions, or values.

    This approach is called tagless-final style [1], pioneered by
    Carette and Kiselyov and later rediscovered under the name "Object
    algebras" by Oliviera and Cook [2]. We encourage to read those
    papers and accompanying literature, but it is not strictly needed,
    especially since the underlying idea is pretty simple.

    In the final style, an embedded language is not represented by an
    abstract syntax tree or some intermediate representation data
    structure, but by denotations in a semantic algebra. Where the
    semantic algebra is an implementation (structure) of the language
    signature. Or, in other words, it is its denotational semantics.

    The structure may choose, basically, any denotations, as long as
    it fits the signature. For example, the language could be denoted
    with its textual representation, BIL code, LLVM IR, BIR, sets of
    reachable addresses, and so on. In other words, an implementation
    of the Core signature could be seen as an analysis that computes the
    property of a term.

    Unlike a classical final approach described in [1] the Core Theory
    signatures do not include any abstract types, all types mentioned
    in the theories are defined on the scope of the Core Theory. This
    constraint basically turns a structure, which implements the
    Theory, into a simple array of functions, a first class value with
    no caveats (like types escaping the scope, etc).

    To enable each semantic algebra to have its own denotation we
    employ ['a Knowledge.Value.t]. Thus both Core Theory values and
    effects are instances of the Knowledge Value, parametrized by
    corresponding class indices. The Knowledge Value is an instance of
    Domain, that makes it ideal for representing the denotational
    semantics of programs. The Knowledge value is an extensible
    record, where each field corresponds to a particular denotation,
    it is possible to store several denotations in one Knowledge
    value.

    Denotational semantics is composable, i.e., a denotation of
    a term is composed from denotations of its constituent terms.
    However, some denotations are context dependent. To enable
    this, we made a term denotation an instance of ['a knowledge],
    i.e., a knowledge dependent computation.

    To summarize, a denotation is a structure that implements methods
    of the corresponding structure. Each method corresponds to a
    language form, e.g, [val add  : 'a bitv -> 'a bitv -> 'a bitv],
    corresponds to an addition of two bitvectors. The implementation,
    builds the denotation of the term from the denotations of its
    inputs, e.g.,

    {[
      let add x y =
        x >>-> fun x ->
        y >>-> fun y ->
        match x, y with
        | Some x, Some y -> const (Bitvec.(x + y))
        | _ -> nonconst
    ]}

    Where [>>->] extracts the module specific denotation and [const],
    [noncost] put them back (assuming that the denotation is the
    classical constant folding lattice).

    The final style makes it easy to write a fold-style analysis, such
    as constant folding, taint analysis, etc. Since all terms are
    knowledge dependent computations, i.e., wrapped into the knowledge
    monad, which turns any computation into a fixed-point computation,
    it is also possible to write data-flow analysis and other forms of
    abstract interpretation. In fact, it was shown, that any
    optimization or analysis could be written in the final style in a
    modular and composable way [3]. However, the classical approach,
    that uses tagged AST and pattern matching is not denied at all.

    Since the denotation could be anything (that is an instance of
    domain), it is quite natural to use BIL, and BIR, or any other
    concrete syntax tree as a possible denotation. Therefore, it is
    possible to extract those denotations and write your analysis
    using the save haven of pattern matching.


    {2 Writing a new denotation}

    Any denotation must be an instance of the Core signature. However,
    it is not always required to implement all methods, as they could
    be inherited from other instance or filled in with the Empty
    Theory. Once analysis is written it should be declared, so that it
    could be later run, e.g., let's extend a hypothetical
    ["constant-tracker"] analysis:

    {[
      let () =
        Theory.declare "my-constant-tracker"
          Theory.instance ~require:["bap.std:constant-tracker"] >>=
        Theory.require >>|
        fun (module Base) : Theory.core -> (module struct
          include Base
          let add x y =
            printf "add is called!\n%!";
            add x y
        end
    ]}

    The real analysis should store it results either in the knowledge
    base or directly in denotations of the terms (or in both places).

    {2 Instantiating a theory}

    To use a theory we need to instantiate it. In the previous section
    we instantiated a theory using the [Theory.require] function, that
    returns a previously declared theory. But what if we need to use
    several denotations, e.g., when we want to have both a
    constant-tracker and BIL for our analysis.

    The final style implementations, in Scala, OCaml, and Haskell,
    usually employ functors or type classes, which both require a user
    to select an instance of a type class, which should be used in
    the given context. Some languages allow only one instance of a class
    per type, others allow multiple, but still needs a declaration of
    some instances as canonical.

    The Core Theory addresses this issue by leveraging the structure
    of the Knowledge universal values and instantiating all theory
    instances simultaneously, so that for each language term the sum
    of all denotations is provided. To exclude the overhead of
    evaluating denotations that might be unused, it is possible to
    limit the set of instantiated theories by specifying a concrete
    list of required theories. The requirements are specified in the
    form of semantic tags instead of concrete theory names, to prevent
    explicit dependencies on implementations. However, it is still
    possible to explicitly request a particular theory.

    It is also possible to define the context of the theory, to enable
    those theories that are not generic and are applicable only to the
    specified context. For example,

    {[

      Theory.instance ()
        ~context:["arm"; "arm-gnueabi"]
        ~requires:[
          "variable-recovery";
          "stack-frame-analysis";
          "structural-analysis";
          "floating-point";
          "bap.std:bil-semantics"
        ] >>=
      Theory.require >>= fun (module Theory) ->

    ]}

    In the example above, theories that are specific to ARM
    architecture, in particular to the arm-gnueabi ABI, will be
    instantiated (in addition to other general theories). The
    [requires] parameter specifies a few semantic tags, describing
    what kind of semantic information is needed, as well as one theory
    explicitly, the [bap.std:bil-semantics], to ensure that each term
    has a BIL denotation.

    {2 Parsing binary code}

    After a theory is instantiated it could be used to build terms,
    which will trigger analyses associated with each instantiated
    theory.

    However, a program is usually represented as a binary machine
    code, which should be parsed into the Core Theory terms. This
    process is called {i lifting} and program components that do
    lifting are called {i lifters}.

    Lifting is a notoriously hard task, since the machine code is an
    untyped representation and Core Theory terms are rigidly typed. To
    alleviate this problem, the Core Theory library provides a helper
    module [Parser] which could be used to lift an untyped
    representation into the typed Core Theory term.

    It is also possible to reuse lifters which translate the machine
    code in some IL, but writing a parser form that IL. The [Parser]
    module is especially useful here, since it was specifically
    designed for such use-cases.

    (** Value Sorts.

        A concrete and extensible representation of a value sort. The
        sort usually holds the static information about the value
        representation, like the width of a bitvector, the
        representation format of a floating point number, and so on.

        This module is mostly needed when a new sort is defined. The
        Core Theory provides a predefined collection of sorts, here is
        the list:

        - {!Bitv} - bitvectors, e.g., [BitVec(i)]
        - {!Mem} - memories, e.g., [Mem(BitVec(i), BitVec(j)]
        - {!Float} - floating points, e.g., [Float(IEEE754(2, 8, 23), BitVec(32)];
        - {!Rmode} - rounding mode, e.g., [Rmode].

        This module defines a simple DSL for specifying sorts, the DSL
        grammar is made only from three rules:
        {v
           sort = sym | int | sort(sort)
        v}

        The DSL is embedded into the host language with an infix
        operator [@->] for application, e.g., OCaml grammar for sorts is:

        [v
          sort = sym exp | int exp | sort "@->" sort
          exp  = ?a valid OCaml expression?
        v]

        Both symbols and numbers are indexed with a type index, which
        serves as a witness of the sort value, e.g.,
        {[
          type int8
          let int8 : int8 num sort = Sort.int 8
        ]}

        Type indices enable explicit reflection of the target language
        type system in the host type system, while still keeping the
        typing rules under designer's control.

        As a working example, let's develop a sort for binary
        fixed-point numbers. We need to encode the type of the
        underlying bitvector as well as the scaling factor. Suppose,
        we chose to encode the scaling factor by an integer position
        of the point, e.g., 8 means scaling factor 2^8, i.e., a point
        fixed on 8th bit from the left.

        The syntax of our sort will be [Fixpoint(<num>,BitVec(<num>))],
        but we will keep it private to enable further extensions. The
        structure of the sort is explicitly captured in its type, in
        our case, it will be ['p num -> 's Bitv.t -> fixpoint sym],
        but since we want to keep it is hidden by our type [('p,'s) t].
        The same as with the built-in [Bitv] and [Mem] sorts.

        We declare a [fixpoint] constructor and keep it private, to
        ensure that only we can construct (and refine) fixpoint
        sorts. Since the sort type is abstract, we also need to
        provide functions that access arguments of our sort.

        Finally, we need to provide the [refine] function, that will
        cast an untyped sort to its type representation, essentially
        proving that the sort is a valid fixpoint sort.
        {[

          module Fixpoint : sig

            let bits s = Value.Sort.(hd (tl s))

  (** The Basic Theory of Floating Points.

      Floating point numbers represent a finite subset of the set of
      real numbers. Some formats also extend this set with special
      values to represent infinities or error conditions. This, in
      general, exceeds the scope of the floating point theory, however
      the theory includes predicates with domains that potentially may
      include this special numbers, e.g., [is_nan]. For floating point
      formats that do not support special values, such predicates will
      become constant functions.

      All operations in the Floating Point theory are defined in terms
      of operations on real numbers. Since floating point numbers
      represent only a subset of the real set,
      denotations select a number from the set of numbers of the
      floating point sort using concrete rules expressed in terms of
      rounding modes. The rounding mode is a parameter of many
      operations, denoted with a term of sort [rmode].

  (** The theory of floating point numbers modulo transcendental functions.

      This signature includes several functions that can be expressed
      in terms of a finite sequence of the operations of addition,
      multiplication, and root extraction. Despite the fact, that
      those operation are defined in the Basic Theory of Floating
      points ([Fbasic)], operations in this signature couldn't be
      expressed in terms of [Fbasic] because the set of floating
      points is finite. Therefore the operations in this signature are
      defined in terms of real numbers arithmetic.

      For example, the following expression is not true for all [x,y,m]:

      [fmul m x (fmul m x x) = pown m x (succ (succ one))],

      E.g., when [fmul m x x] is not denoted with [x^2], but the

  (** Generates parsers of untyped ASTs into type Core Theory terms.

      The [Parser.Make] functor produces a recursive-descent parser
      for a family of untyped BIL-style languages.

      In general, the problem of parsing an untyped representation into
      richly-typed term, such as the Core Theory term is convoluted if
      not tedious. This module along with the signatures in the
      Grammar module facilitates this task, at least for typical
      intermediate languages such as BIL and its variants.

      The recursive-descent parser has six top-level rules, for
      each supported term sort:
      - [bitv] - produces terms of type ['a bitv];
      - [bool] - produces terms of type [bool];
      - [mem] - produces terms of type [('k,'v) mem];
      - [stmt] - produces terms of type ['a effect];
      - [float] - produces terms of type [('f,'s) float];
      - [rmode] - produces terms of type [rmode].

      The target language is not required to represent all those terms
      or to distinguish types in the same way as this parser do.

      To implement a parser for a target language all five rules must
      be provided, but they could be incomplete or empty.

      Each rule is a function, that takes a parser that recognizes a
      sub-language of a term that is parsed by the function, and the
      expression or statement of the target language. The function has
      to map each non-terminal of the target language to a rule in the
      provided subgrammar, i.e.,

      {v
        let bitv : type t r. (t,exp,r) bitv_parser =
          fun (module S) -> function
          | symbol .. symbol -> S.rule1 symbol .. symbol
          | ..
          | symbol .. symbol -> S.ruleN symbol .. symbol

      v}

      Let's take the BIL parser as a concrete example,

      {[
        let bitv : type t r. (t,exp,r) bitv_parser =
          fun (module S) -> function
            | Cast (HIGH,n,x) -> S.high n x
            | .. -> ..
            | Cast (SIGNED,n,x) -> S.signed n x
            | BinOp(PLUS,x,y) -> S.add x y
            | .. -> ..
            | BinOp(XOR,x,y) -> S.logxor x y
            | Let (v,y,z) when is_bit v -> S.let_bit (Var.name v) y z
            | .. -> ..
            | Let (v,y,z) when is_mem v -> S.let_mem (Var.name v) y z
            | .. -> ..
              (* ill-formed expressions *)
            | Let _
            | Store (_, _, _, _, _)
            | Unknown (_, (Mem _|Unk)) as exp -> fail exp `Bitv; S.error
      ]}

      We omitted most of the rules for brevity, see the full
      definition in the BIL plugin. The mapping is pretty
      straightforward. As this example highlights, the parser is also
      playing the role of a type checker. Expressions that are not valid
      in the given context has to be mapped to the [error] term. The
      term itself doesn't have any payload and works as an abort
      symbol for the parser. Since parser are expected to be
      implemented in a plugin code, they can utilize to full extend
      the interface with the user to provide fancy error messages.

      The context of the expression is automatically inferred by the
      parser generator with the help of the top-level syntactic rules
      provided by the user. In the example above, the context of the
      let-bound expression is determined from the type of the
      variable. For some languages, it might be necessary to write a
      type-inference algorithm.

      Note, that the parser must return a value of type [S.t] which is
      abstract and couldn't be unified with the type of the Core
      Theory term. Therefore, the rule implementer is limited to the
      language that is defined by the transitive closure of the
      sub-grammar that is passed to the function that implements the
      rule. That basically makes this parser infrastructure
      non-extensible, which is alleviated by the fact that provided
      sub-grammars are very rich. The task of writing an extensible
      parser is still a research question.


      {3 Notes on future extensions}

      We're reserving the right to extend the grammar signatures in
      the [Parser.Grammar] module without changing the major version
      of the library, since those modules are designed to be used
      co-inductively (as types of modules that are  provided by the
      library, not required), therefore adding more definitions to
      the grammars which could be used by the library user makes the
      library strictly more powerful (stronger). To prevent any
      issues, it is recommended not to open the provided module (i.e.,
      always use the grammar rules via the dot notation, e.g., S.add),
      since adding a new rule may hide the existing functions in the

  module Parser : sig

    (** An untyped grammar for a subset of Core Theory languages.

        This module defines grammars for six sub-languages for each
        sort of Core Theory terms.


        {3 Notation}

        Each rule in the grammar [S] returns a value of type [S.t],
        which is a semantic action that will eventually build a Core
        Theory term of a corresponding to the rule type. This type is
        abstract and is totally co-inductive (i.e., it could also
        produced, there are no grammar rules (functions) that consume
        values of this type.

        Since each grammar rule will eventually build a Core Theory
        term, we will describe rules using the Core Theory
        denotations. The parser generator will invoke recursively the
        top-level rules on each non-terminal. Those rules are
        referenced using the following names:

        - [bitv] - parses the language of bitvectors;
        - [bool] - parses the language of booleans;
        - [mem]  - parses the language of memories;
        - [stmt] - parses the language of statements;
        - [float] - parses the language of floats;
        - [rmode] - parses the language of rounding modes.

        The parsing rules occasionally need to refer to the sorts of
        therms, we use the following short-hand notation for sorts:
        - [bits m = Bitv.define m] - a sort of bitvectors with [m] bits;
        - [Bool.t] - the sort of booleans;
        - [mems k v = Mem.define k v] - a sort of memories;

        Finally, the width associated with the sort [s] is denoted
        with [size s = Bitv.size s].

        Example,

        {[
          (** [add x y] is [add (bitv x) (bitv y)].  *)
          val add : exp -> exp -> t
        ]}

        says that the grammar rule [add] interprets its arguments in
        the [bitv] context (recursively calls the [bitv] function) and
        have the denotation of the [add p q] term of the Core Theory,
        where [p = bitv x] and [q = bitv y].

        {4 Contexts}

        To ensure the freshness of generated variables and to enable a
        higher-order abstract syntax style (a generalization of the De
        Bruijn notation) we wrap each semantic action in a context
        that holds the binding rules.

        The [var] family of grammar rules rename the passed names if
        they are bound in the renaming context, which is denoted with
        [context s] which is a function that returns the name bound to
        [s] in the context or [s] if it is unbound.

        The [let_<T> n ...] and [tmp_<T> n ...] take the old name
        [n], create a fresh variable [n'] and append the [n,n']
        binding to the context in which the grammar rule is invoked,
        denoted with [rule [<non-term>|n->n']], e.g.,

        {[
          [let_reg s x y] is [scoped @@ fun v -> (bitv x) (bitv [y|s->v])]
        ]}

        As a result of the [let_reg] rule applications any free occurrence
        of the variable [s] will be substituted with the freshly
        generated variable [v]. This will ensure alpha-equivalence of
        expressions that use the [let_<T>] forms.

        The [tmp_<T>] rules are basically the same as [let_<T>] except
        that the scope of the freshly created variable is indefinite,
        so these forms could be used to create hygienic symbol
        generators.

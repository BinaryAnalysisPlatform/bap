(** Trace is a sequence of events accompanied with meta information.

    The sequence is lazy if possible, i.e., underlying event
    transports shall not produce events unless they are requested.

    The event is a value of type [value]. Event type is reified with
    [Value.Tag]. A set of event types in a given trace is an
    intersection of the following three sets:

    - Event types supported by a trace tool;

    - Event types that are supported by an event transport (i.e.,
      protocol)

    - Types of events that has occurred in the course of the given
      trace.

    Since it is worthwhile to know whether a particular event is not the
    trace because it didn't occur during program execution, but not
    because it wasn't detected by a trace tool or dropped by a given
    transport, we provide [supports] function, to query whether the
    given event type is really supported (and thus might occur) by a
    given trace.

    The meta information is also represented using [value] type, and
    thus can contain virtually any data. Meta information is indexed
    with [tag] value.

type io_error = [
  | `Protocol_error of Error.t   (** Data encoding problem         *)

]

]

(** {2 Serialization}

    Serialization is dispatched by a URI describing data source or
    destination. URI contains enough information to uniquely designate
    data format and transporting options.

(** [load ~monitor uri] fetches trace from a provided [uri]. 
    [monitor] is fail_on_error by default. *)
val load : ?monitor:monitor -> Uri.t -> (t,error) Result.t

(** [save uri] pushes trace to a provided [uri] *)
val save : Uri.t -> t -> (unit,error) Result.t

(** {2 Meta attributes}

    Meta information relates to the whole trace.

val id : t -> id

(** [set_attr trace attr value] updates [trace] meta attribute [attr]
    with a provided value. *)
val set_attr : t -> 'a tag -> 'a -> t

(** [get_attr trace attr] retrieves a value of a given attribute
    [attr] *)
val get_attr : t -> 'a tag -> 'a option

(** [has_attr trace attr] evaluates to [true] if [trace] has a given
    attribute [attr] *)
val has_attr : t -> 'a tag -> bool

(** [tool trace] returns a descriptor of a tool that was used to
    create the [trace]. *)
val tool : t -> tool

(** [meta trace] returns all [trace] attributes as a dictionary  *)
val meta : t -> dict

(** [set_meta trace meta] substitutes meta attributes of a [trace] with
    attributes taken from a dictionary [meta].*)
val set_meta : t -> dict -> t

(** {2 Querying  data}  *)

(** [supports trace feature] is [true] if a tool that was used to
    generate the trace, as well as transporting protocol and
    underlying format support the given feature. *)
val supports : t -> 'a tag -> bool

(** [memoize trace] eagerly loads all the trace into memory.   *)
val memoize : t -> t

(** [find_all_matching trace matcher] returns a sequence of events
    matching with a provided [matcher]. *)
val find_all_matching : t -> 'a Value.Match.t -> 'a seq

(** [fold_matching trace matcher ~f ~init] applies function [f]
    consequently to all matching trace event. Matching is defined
    using value [matcher]. The following example will collect all
    memory operations from a trace:
    {[
      let collect_memory_operations trace =
        List.rev @@
        fold_matching trace ~init:[] ~f:(fun xs x -> x @ xs)
          Value.Match.(begin
              case memory_load  (fun x  -> [`Load x])  @@
              case memory_store (fun x  -> [`Store x]) @@
              default           (fun () -> [])
            end)
    ]}
*)
val fold_matching : t -> 'a Value.Match.t -> f:('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> init:'b -> 'b

(** [contains trace tag] returns [Some true] if a provided event
    occurs in a trace, [Some false] if it may occur (i.e., is
    supported), but is not in the trace, and [None] if the event is not
    supported at all. *)
val contains : t -> 'a tag -> bool option

(** [event trace] returns a sequence of events of the [trace].
    This function should be used if the above specified functions
    doesn't answer your needs.*)
val events : t -> event seq

(** {2 Trace construction}  *)

(** [create tool] creates an trace that will contain events, produced
    by a specified [tool]. Initially trace contains an empty sequence
    of events. *)
val create : tool -> t

(** [unfold ~monitor tool ~f ~init] creates a trace by unfolding a function [f].
    The produces sequence is lazy, i.e., functions are called as
    demanded. [monitor] is fail_on_error by default. *)
val unfold : ?monitor:monitor -> tool -> f:('a -> (event Or_error.t * 'a) option) -> init:'a -> t

(** [unfold' ~monitor tool ~f] is a simplified version of [unfold] *)
val unfold' : ?monitor:monitor -> tool -> f:(unit -> event Or_error.t option) -> t

(** [add_event trace tag] appends an event to a sequence of events of
    [trace]. *)
val add_event : t -> 'a tag -> 'a -> t

(** [append trace events] creates a trace with a sequence of events
    composed from events of the [trace] following the [events],
    provided as an argument. *)
val append : t -> event seq -> t


(** {2 Extension mechanism}

    A trace is a collaborative work of several underlying layers:
    - a trace tool itself
    - a transport, that delivers data from the [tool]
    - a protocol that is used to deliver and interpret data.

    For example, a tools is an instrumented qemu-user, a transport can
    be just a file, and protocol can be Google protobuf.

    Ideally, this three instances should be totally orthogonal, so
    that one can match them. In real life, we will strive to support
    only specific combinations.

    The extension mechanism allows a user to add support for new
    transports and protocols. The separation between transport and
    protocol is left beyond the scope of this interface. A user is
    welcome to built its own protocol stacks and reify them into
    explicit API.

    The interface is designed to support both static and dynamic trace
    tools. Although, the interface to control a dynamic tool is also
    left outside of the trace interface.

    In order to establish a correspondence between a concrete trace
    instance and a trace generator a unique id is used. Each time a
    trace is opened a fresh new unique id is generated that is passed
    to both sides: to the trace (accessible via [id] function) and to
    the trace reader (passed as a parameter). This [id] can be used
    from the client side to dynamically control a trace tool.

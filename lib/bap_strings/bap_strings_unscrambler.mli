(** [Make(Alphabet)] creates an unscrambler for the given alphabet.

    The unscrambler will build all words from the provided sequence of
    characters, essentially it is the same as playing scrabble. For
    example, from characters [h,e,l,l,o] it will build words "hell",
    "hello", "ell", "hoe", and so on, provided that they are known to
    the unscrambler, i.e., present in its dictionary.

    The unscrambler requires to know the alphabet of the language
    beforehand, because it uses efficient trie-like representation of
    the dictionary that enables O(1) search for words (O(1) in terms
    of the dictionary size).

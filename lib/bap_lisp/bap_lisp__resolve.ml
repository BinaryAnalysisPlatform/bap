(* ensures that all definitions belong to the same context class.

   if any two definitions are equivalent but not the same, then we
   drop all definitions, since if we have more than one definition at
   this stage, then the only left method of refinement is the
   overloading, and we do not want to allow the last stage to choose
   from equivalent definitions based on their type. For example

   Suppose we have two definition with the following types:

   [d1 : ((arch arm) (compiler gcc)) => (i32)]

   and

   [d2 : ((arch arm) (container elf)) => (i32 i32)]

   And we apply it two a single argument [(d x)], and the context is

   [((arch arm) (compiler gcc) (container elf) ..)], then we have two
   perfectly valid and applicable to the current context definitions,
   and we can't choose one or another based on the number of
   arguments.

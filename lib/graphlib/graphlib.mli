      {3 Graph library}

      {!Graphlib} is a generic library that extends a well known
      OCamlGraph library. {!Graphlib} uses its own, more reach,
      {!Graph} interface that is isomorphic to OCamlGraph's [Sigs.P]
      signature for persistant graphs. Two functors witness the
      isomorphism of the interfaces:
      {!Graphlib.To_ocamlgraph} and {!Graphlib.Of_ocamlgraph}. Thanks
      to these functors, any algorithm written for OCamlGraph can be
      used on [Graphlibs] graph and vice verse.

      The {!Graph} interface provides a richer interface in a Core
      style. Nodes and Edges implements {!Opaque} data structure,
      i.e., they come with Maps, Sets, Hashtbls, etc, preloaded (e.g.,
      [G.Node.Set] is a set of node for graph implementation, provided
      by a module named [G]). Graphs also implement {!Printable}
      interface, that makes them much easier to debug.

      Along with graphs, auxiliary data structures are provided, like
      {{!Path}path} to represent paths in graph, {{!Tree}tree} for
      representing different graph spannings, {{!Partition}partition}
      for graph partitioning, and more.

      {!Graphlib} is a library that provides a set of generic
      algorithms, as well as implementations of a {!Graph} interface,
      and a suite of preinstantiated graphs.

      Contrary to OCamlGraph, each {!Graphlib} interface is provided
      as a function, not a functor. Thus making there use syntactically
      easier. Also, {!Graphlib} heavily uses optional and keyword
      parameters. For die-hards, many algorithms still have functor
      a interface.

      All {!Graphlib} algorithms accept a first-class module with
      graph implementation as a first argument. You can think of this
      parameter as an explicit type class. Later, when modular
      implicits will be accepted in OCaml, this parameter can be
      omitted. But for now, we need to pass them.

      A recommended way to work with {!Graphlib} is to bind the
      chosen implementation with some short name, usually [G] would be
      a good choice:

   {[module G = Graphlib.Make(String)(Bool)]}

      This will bind name [G] with a graph implementation that has
      [string] nodes, with edges labeled by values of type [bool].

      To create a graph of type [G.t] one can use a generic
      {!Graphlib.create} function:

   {[let g = Graphlib.create (module G) ~edges:[
       "entry", "loop", true;
       "loop", "exit", true;
       "loop", "loop", false;
     ] ()]}

      This will create an instance of type [G.t]. Of course, it is
      still possible to use non-generic [G.empty], [G.Node.insert],
      [G.Edge.insert].

  (** Graph signature.  *)
  module type Graph = sig
    (** Graph is mathematical data structure that is used to represent
        relations between elements of a set. Usually, graph is defined
        as an ordered pair of two sets - a set of vertices and a set
        of edges that is a 2-subset of the set of nodes,

        {v G = (V,E). v}

        In Graphlib vertices (called nodes in our parlance) and edges
        are labeled. That means that we can associate data with edges
        and nodes. Thus graph should be considered as an associative
        data structure. And from mathematics perspective graph is
        represented as an ordered 6-tuple, consisting of a set of nodes,
        edges, node labels, edge labels, and two functions that maps
        nodes and edges to their corresponding labels:

        {v G = (N, E, N', E', ν : N -> N', ε : E -> E'), v}

        where set [E] is a subset of [ N × N ].

        With this general framework an unlabeled graph can be
        represented as:

        {v G = (N, E, N, E, ν = λx.x, ε = λx.x) v}

        Another possible representation of an unlabeled graph would be:

        {v G = (N, E, {u}, {v}, ν = λx.u, ε = λx.v). v}

        Implementations are free to choose any suitable representation
        of graph data structure, if it conforms to the graph signature
        and all operations follows the described semantics and
        properties of a graph structure are preserved.

        The axiomatic semantics of operations on a graph is described by
        a set of postconditions. To describe the semantics of an
        operation in terms of input and output arguments, we project
        graphs to its fields with the following notation
        [<field>(<graph>)], e.g., [N(g)] is a set of nodes of graph [g].

        Only the strongest postcondition is specified, e.g., if it is
        specified that [νn = l], then it also means that

        [n ∈ N ∧ ∃u((u,v) ∈ E ∨ (v,u) ∈ E) ∧ l ∈ N' ∧ ...]

        In other words the structure [G] of the graph G is an invariant
        that is always preserved.

    (** [depth_first_search (module G) ~init g].  It is the most
        important algorithm of the Graphlib. It builds a forest of
        spanning trees of a graph, classifies graph edges and numbers
        nodes. It is a Swiss-army knife, that is very useful in
        implementing many other algorithms. You can think of this
        function as [fold] on steroids. But unlike [fold], that
        accepts only one function, the [depth_first_search] accepts 5
        different functions, that will be called on different
        situations, allowing you to «fill in the blanks» of your
        algorithm.

        Although [depth_first_search] doesn't allow you to drive the
        walk itself, there're still ways to do this, using {!filtered}
        function. That allows you to hide nodes or edges from the
        walker, thus effectively erasing them from a graph, without
        even touching it.

        @param rev if true, then the graph [g] is traversed in a
        reverse direction. This is essentially the same, as reversing
        the graph, but make sure, that you've adjusted the start
        node.

        @param start if specified, then the traverse will be started
        from the node that is equal to node [start]. Otherwise the
        traverse is started from the first node of a graph as returned
        by [G.nodes], i.e., usually it is an arbitrary node.

        @param start_tree [node] [state] is called on each new spanning
        tree started by the algorithm. If all nodes are reachable from
        the start node, then this function will be called only
        once. If all nodes of a graph are connected, then this
        function, will be called only once.

        @param enter_node [pre] [node] [state] is called when a node
        is first discovered by the traversal. The number is a preorder
        number, also known as depth-first number or [dfnum]. All nodes
        are entered in a pre-order.

        @param leave_node [rpost] [node] [state] is called when all
        successors of a [node] are left (finished). The provided
        number is a reverse post order number, that also defines a
        topological sorting order of a graph. All nodes, are left in
        a post order.

        @param enter_edge [kind] [edge] [state] is called when and
        [edge] is first discovered. Edge kinds are described below.
        The destination of the edge may not be discovered (i.e.,
        entered) yet. But the source is already entered (but not
        finished).

        @param leave_edge [kind] [edge] [state] is called when the
        edge destination is at least started.

        {2 Edges classification}

        An edge in a spanning tree, produced by a depth first walk,
        can belong to one of the following category (kind):
        - Tree edges constitutes a spanning tree [T] of a graph;
        - Forward edges go from an ancestor to a descendants in
          a tree [T];
        - Back edges go from descendants to ancestors in [T],
          including node itself (they are also known as cycle
          edges).
        - Cross edges - all other edges, i.e., such edges for
          which doesn't go from ancestors to descendants or vice
          verse. They are possible since, tree defines only partial
          ordering.

        With respect to a pre-order and reverse post-ordering
        numbering the source [x] and a destination [y] of an edge with
        a given [kind] satisfy to the following inequalities:

        {v
            +---------+-----------------+---------------------+
            | Tree    | pre[x] < pre[y] | rpost[x] < rpost[y] |
            | Forward | pre[x] < pre[y] | rpost[x] < rpost[y] |
            | Back    | pre[x] ≥ pre[y] | rpost[x] ≥ rpost[y] |
            | Cross   | pre[x] > pre[y] | rpost[x] < rpost[y] |
            +---------+-----------------+---------------------+
          v}

        Note: since there can be more than one valid order of
        traversal of the same graph, (and thus more than one valid
        spanning tree), depending on a traversal the same edges can be
        classified differently. With the only exception, that a back
        edge will be always a back edge, disregarding the particular
        order.

        {3 Complexity}

        The algorithm is linear in time. It uses constant stack
        space. In fact, for small graphs it uses stack, but for large
        graphs dynamically switches to a heap storage. The space
        complexity is bounded by linear function of the graph depth.  *)

    (** [dominators (module G) g entry] builds a dominators tree for
        a given graph.

        Definition: a {b walk} is a sequence of alternating nodes and
        edges, where each edge's endpoints are the preceding and
        following nodes in the sequence.

        Definition: a node [v] is {b reachable} if there exists a walk
        starting from [entry] and ending with [v].

        Definition: node [u] {b dominates} [v] if [u = v] or if all walks
        from [entry] to [v] contains [u].

        Definition: node [u] {b strictly dominates} [v] if it dominates
        [v] and [u <> v].

        Definition: node [u] {b immediately dominates} [v] if it
        strictly dominates [v] and there is no other node that
        strictly dominates [v] and is dominated by [u].

        Algorithm computes a dominator tree [t] that has the following
        properties:
        + Sets of graph nodes and tree nodes are equal;
        + if node [u] is a parent of node [v], then node [u]
           immediately dominates node [v];
        + if node [u] is an ancestors of node [v], then node [u]
           strictly dominates node [v];
        + if node [v] is a child of node [u], then node [u]
           immediately dominates node [v];
        + if node [v] is a descendant of node [u], then node [u]
           strictly dominates node [v].

        If every node of graph [g] is reachable from a provided
        [entry] node, then properties (2) - (5) are reversible, i.e.,
        an [if] statement can be read as [iff], and the tree is
        unique.


        {b Lemma}: Everything dominates unreachable block.

        {b Proof}: (by contradiction) suppose there exists a node [u] that
        doesn't dominate unreachable block [v]. That means, that there
        exists a path from [entry] to [v] that doesn't contain
        [u]. But that means, at least, that [v] is reachable. This  is
        a contradiction with the original statement that [v] is
        unreachable. {b Qed.}

        If some nodes of graph [g] are unreachable from the provided
        [entry] node, then they are dominated by all other nodes of a
        graph. It means that the provided system is under constrained
        and has more then one solution (i.e., there exists more than
        one tree, that satisfies properties (1) - (5). In a current
        implementation each unreachable node is immediately dominated
        by the [entry], if the [entry] is in graph.

        To get a post-dominator tree, reverse the graph by passing
        [true] to [rev] and pass exit node as a starting node.

        Note: although it is not imposed by the algotihm, but it is a
        good idea to have an entry node, that doesn't have any
        predecessors. Usually, this is what is silently assumed in

        {3 Data Flow Analysis and Abstract Interpretation}

        The [fixpoint] function implements a general fixed pointed
        iterative solver, that is suitable for implementing data-flow
        analysis or abstract interpreters. This section will provide
        some insight on how a particular choice of parameters affects
        the result of computation. We will start with a small
        introduction to the theory of Data Flow Analysis and Abstract
        Interpretation, with respect to the solution of a system of
        fixed point equations.

        {4 Introduction}

        The data domain is a set of values equiped with a partial
        ordering operation [(L,<=)], also know as a lattice or a
        poset. We assume, that the lattice is complete, i.e., there
        are two special elements of a set that are called [top] and
        [bot] (the bottom value). The top element is the greatest
        element of the set L, i.e., for all [x] in [L], [x <=
        top]. Correspondingly, the bottom element is the least element
        of the set [L], i.e., for all [x] in [L], [bot <= x]. It is not
        required by the framework that the lattice has both or any of
        them, however their presence makes the explanation easier, and
        since any lattice could be artificially extended with these
        two elements, their introduction will not introduce a loss of
        generality. Since values of the lattice [L] represent
        information, the partial ordering between two pieces of
        information [a] and [b], e.g., [a <= b], tells us that [a]
        contains no more information than [b]. Therefore the [top]
        value contans all the information, representable in the
        lattice, correspondingly the [bot] value represents an absence
        of information. Thus, we will consider the bottom value as an
        over approximation (or a lower approximation in terms of the
        lattice ordering relation), as an absence of information
        cannot contain false statements (vacuous truth). Assuming,
        that there is some value [t], [bot <= t <= top] that represents
        a ground truth (that is usually unobtainable), we say that all
        values that are less than or equal [t] are over-approximations
        of the truth, and the rest of the values, are
        under-approximations. Under-approximations under estimate a
        behavior of a system, and usually represent information about
        a system that is not true, hence an under approximate solution,
        is usually unsafe to use. In general, our task is to find an
        over approximation that is as close as possible to the ground
        truth [t].

        A solution to a fixed point equation (i.e., an equation of the
        form [x = f(x)]) could be obtainted by starting from some
        initial approximation [x0] and repeatedly applying [f] to it,
        until the solution is found, i.e., [x = f(... f(f(x0)) ...)].
        In general, a function may have multiple (or no at all) fixed
        points. If a function has several fixed points, then we can
        distinguish two extremums - the least fixed point [lfp] and
        the greatest fixed point [gfp] w.r.t the ordering of lattice
        [L]. Assuming that function [f] is positive monotonic function
        (i.e., [x <= y] implies that [f(x) <= f(y)]), thechoice of the
        initial value [x0] denotes which of the two fixed points is
        computed. When we start with the bot value, we are ascending
        from it until the least fixed point is obtained. Dually, if we
        will start with the top value, we will descend until the
        maximal fixpoint is reached. Assuming that both fixpoints are
        lower approximations of the ground truth, we can easily see,
        that the maximal fixpoint solution is more attractive, as it
        bears more information than the minimal (unless both are the
        same). However, the ascending search, bears a nice property,
        that any intermediate solution is an over-approximation of the
        ground truth (i.e., we are monotonically aggregating facts).

        In general, a function may not have a solution at all, or the
        solution may not be computable in practice, i.e., when the chain
        of function applications [x = f(... f(x0) ...)] is either
        infinite or effectively infinite (e.g., 2^64 applications). The
        Tarksi theorem states that if [L] is complete and [f] is
        monotone, then it has a fixed point. If a lattice has a
        limited height (maximum length of chain of elements, such that
        x0 < x1 < .. < xM) then we will obtain a solution in no more
        than [M] steps. However, if [M] is very big, or infinite, then
        the solution won't be find in general, and the computation may
        not terminate.

        This brings us to the main distinction between Abstract
        Interpretation and Data Flow Analysis. The latter usually
        deals with lattice that have finite heights, while the former
        deals with very big and infinite lattices. To accelerate the
        convergence of a chain of approximations, a special technique
        called [widening] is used. Widening can be seen as an
        operation that jumps over several applications of the function
        [f], hence it actually accelerates the convergence. Given,
        that widening jumps forward in the chain, it is possible to
        overshoot the fixed point solution. This can potential involve
        a lossage of precision (in case of the descending chain) or to
        an incorrect solution (in case of the ascending chain).

        So far, we were considering only one equation. However, we
        need to solve a system of equations, denoted by a graph (as
        graph denotes a boolean adjacency matrix [A = {a(i,j)}], such that
        [a(i,j)] is [1] if there is an edge from [i] to [j], and [0]
        otherwise). To solve the system of equations, we need to find
        such vector [x1,..,xM] that solves all equations. In general,
        a system may not have a solution (an over-constrainted system),
        may have one solution, and may have many solutions (under
        constrained system). In our case, the system is not linear, as
        each equation is function of type [L -> L] not [L^M -> N], since
        all input variables are merged with some operator, usually
        [meet] or [join]. A correct choice of the merge opeator ensures
        correctness and convergence of the solution.

        The [meet] operator is a commutative, associative, and
        idempotent operator, such that if [z = meet x y], then [z <= x
        && z <= y] and for all [w] in [L], [w <= x && w <= y] implies [w <=
        z]. The [z] value is called the greatest lower bound ([glb], or
        [inf]) of [x] and [y]. Intuitively, the [meet] operator takes
        two pieces of information and removes all contradictions. Thus
        [z] is the maximal consensus between [x] and [y]. The [top]
        element is the neutral element with respect to the [meet]
        operation, e.g., [meet x top = x]. A consequent application of
        the [meet] operation builds a {i descending chain} of
        approximations, i.e., the amount of information is reduced on
        each step.

        The [join] operator is dual to [meet] and is defined
        correspondingly (with the flipped order). A join of [x] and
        [y] is called the least upper bound ([lub], [sup]) of [x] and
        [y]. Intuitively, the [join] operator takes two
        non-contradictory pieces information and returns their
        concatenation. The [bot] element is the neutral element with
        respect to the [join] operation, e.g., [join x bot = x]. A
        consequent application of the [join] operation builds an
        ascending chain of approximations, i.e., the amount of
        information is increased on each step.

        {4 Using the [fixpoint] function}

        The [fixpoint] interface is trying to be as general as
        possible, but at the same time easy to use. The interface,
        allows a user to choose the direction of approximation
        (ascending vs. descending) and how to accelerate the
        convergence in case of tall lattices by applying narrowing and
        widening. The implentation fixes the iteration strategy (by
        always using the topological ordering). In case if you need a
        fixed point solver, that allows you to use different iteration
        strategies, the [fixpoint][1] library provides a descent
        alternative.

        {5 Using [fixpoint] for Classical Data Flow analysis}

        The classical Data Flow analysis uses the descending chain of
        approximations in a complete lattice with finite (usually very
        small) height. Thus, the [fixpoint] solution is the greatest
        (maximal) fixed point (a maximal set of facts on which all
        equations agree). If the transfer function [f] is monotone and
        distributive, then it is the meet-over-paths (mop) solution,
        in a more general case [gfp <= mop] and [mop <= t] (where [t] is
        the ground truth). (Note, [gfp] is of course the best solution
        to the system of equations, as it is the maximal of all
        solutions. Both [mop] and [t] are not solutions to the given
        system, but define the true properties of a system under test,
        that we are trying to model with the system of fixed point
        equations. The fact that [gfp] is smaller, indicates that our
        model looses the precision (i.e., it is overconstrained). For
        example, the meet-over-path solution is a meet of all possible
        paths, even those that are infeasible, thus the system is
        overconstrained as we are taking into account system
        behaviors that will never happen, this is however safe, to
        overconstraint a system, as it will give us an
        over-approximation of a real system behavior).

        The [fixpoint] function could be easily applied to both
        forward and backward data flow problem, as backward problem
        could be seen as a forward problem on a reversed graph. To
        effectively reverse a graph, set the [rev] flag to [true] and
        set the [enter] parameter to the [exit] node.



        {5 Using [fixpoint] for Abstract Interpretation}

        Abstract Interpretation usually deals with complex and large
        lattices, and applies different heuristics to ensure
        termination with the minimum loss of precision. This usually
        ends up in applying widening and narrowing operations. Since
        widening accelerates by jumping forward in the chain of
        approximations, it can easily overshoot a fixed point, and in
        case of the ascending chain this may lead to a solution that
        is an under approximation of the ground truth. Thus, abstract
        interpretation is usually applied in the descending order. In
        this case the [widen] operation may still overshot the maximal
        fixpoint, that will lead to an over-approximation of the
        ground truth, that is safe, but still looses
        precision. Therefore, it is necessary to apply widening as
        rarely as possible. Unfortunatelly, a question where and when
        to apply widening is undecidable by itself, that's why
        heuristics are used. The [fixpoint] function, provides a
        limited capabilities to control widening via the [step i n x
        x'] function that is called every time a new [i]'th
        approximation [x'] for variable [n] is computed. The [step]
        function must return an upper bound (not necessary the least
        one) of the previous approximation [x] and the new
        approximation [x']. The default, implementation just returns
        [x']. An alternative implementation may widen [x'] if the
        number of steps [i] in the chain is higher than some
        threshold, and/or if [x] is a widening point (e.g., the loop
        header).

        Note: terms widening and narrowing comes from the interval
        analysis where they were first introduced, and correspond to
        the widening of an interval (usually up to infinitiy) and
        narrowing a widened interval based on some heurisitic.

        {6 Using [fixpoint] for general iterative approximation}

        In a general case, the [fixpoint] function could be used to
        compute successive approximations of a solution to a system of
        (in)equations, even if [f] is not monotone, and the lattice is not
        finite. The termination could be guaranteed by limiting the
        maximum number of iterations. And the correctness could be
        ensured by starting from the bottom element, and using the
        ascending chain of approximations. In that case, even a
        partially complete solution would be an over-approximation of
        a real solution. The obtained partial solution could be later
        resumed (and possibly extended with newly obtained facts).


        {4 Implementation}

        The [fixpoint] uses the Kildall iterative algorithm. And
        applies equations in reverse postorder (topological
        order). The solution is represented as an abstract finite
        mapping, that is also used to specify the initial set of
        constraints and the initial value of unconstrained
        variables. It is possible to specify more than one constraint
        to the system of equation (as opposed to the classical
        approach where the constraint denotes only the input for the
        entry node).  *)

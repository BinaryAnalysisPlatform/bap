      {3 Graph library}

      {!Graphlib} is a generic library that extends a well known
      OCamlGraph library. {!Graphlib} uses its own, more reach,
      {!Graph} interface that is isomorphic to OCamlGraph's [Sigs.P]
      signature for persistant graphs. Two functors witness the
      isomorphism of the interfaces:
      {!Graphlib.To_ocamlgraph} and {!Graphlib.Of_ocamlgraph}. Thanks
      to these functors, any algorithm written for OCamlGraph can be
      used on [Graphlibs] graph and vice verse.

      The {!Graph} interface provides a richer interface in a Core
      style. Nodes and Edges implements {!Opaque} data structure,
      i.e., they come with Maps, Sets, Hashtbls, etc, preloaded (e.g.,
      [G.Node.Set] is a set of node for graph implementation, provided
      by a module named [G]). Graphs also implement {!Printable}
      interface, that makes them much easier to debug.

      Along with graphs, auxiliary data structures are provided, like
      {{!Path}path} to represent paths in graph, {{!Tree}tree} for
      representing different graph spannings, {{!Partition}partition}
      for graph partitioning, and more.

      {!Graphlib} is a library that provides a set of generic
      algorithms, as well as implementations of a {!Graph} interface,
      and a suite of preinstantiated graphs.

      Contrary to OCamlGraph, each {!Graphlib} interface is provided
      as a function, not a functor. Thus making there use syntactically
      easier. Also, {!Graphlib} heavily uses optional and keyword
      parameters. For die-hards, many algorithms still have functor
      a interface.

      All {!Graphlib} algorithms accept a first-class module with
      graph implementation as a first argument. You can think of this
      parameter as an explicit type class. Later, when modular
      implicits will be accepted in OCaml, this parameter can be
      omitted. But for now, we need to pass them.

      A recommended way to work with {!Graphlib} is to bind the
      chosen implementation with some short name, usually [G] would be
      a good choice:

      {[module G = Graphlib.Make(String)(Bool)]}

      This will bind name [G] with a graph implementation that has
      [string] nodes, with edges labeled by values of type [bool].

      To create a graph of type [G.t] one can use a generic
      {!Graphlib.create} function:

   {[let g = Graphlib.create (module G) ~edges:[
       "entry", "loop", true;
       "loop", "exit", true;
       "loop", "loop", false;
     ] ()]}

      This will create an instance of type [G.t]. Of course, it is
      still possible to use non-generic [G.empty], [G.Node.insert],
      [G.Edge.insert].

  (** Graph signature.  *)
  module type Graph = sig
    (** Graph is mathematical data structure that is used to represent
        relations between elements of a set. Usually, graph is defined
        as an ordered pair of two sets - a set of vertices and a set
        of edges that is a 2-subset of the set of nodes,

        {v G = (V,E). v}

        In Graphlib vertices (called nodes in our parlance) and edges
        are labeled. That means that we can associate data with edges
        and nodes. Thus graph should be considered as an associative
        data structure. And from mathematics perspective graph is
        represented as an ordered 6-tuple, consisting of a set of nodes,
        edges, node labels, edge labels, and two functions that maps
        nodes and edges to their corresponding labels:

        {v G = (N, E, N', E', ν : N -> N', ε : E -> E'), v}

        where set [E] is a subset of [ N × N ].

        With this general framework an unlabeled graph can be
        represented as:

        {v G = (N, E, N, E, ν = λx.x, ε = λx.x) v}

        Another possible representation of an unlabeled graph would be:

        {v G = (N, E, {u}, {v}, ν = λx.u, ε = λx.v). v}

        Implementations are free to choose any suitable representation
        of graph data structure, if it conforms to the graph signature
        and all operations follows the described semantics and
        properties of a graph structure are preserved.

        The axiomatic semantics of operations on a graph is described by
        a set of postconditions. To describe the semantics of an
        operation in terms of input and output arguments, we project
        graphs to its fields with the following notation
        [<field>(<graph>)], e.g., [N(g)] is a set of nodes of graph [g].

        Only the strongest postcondition is specified, e.g., if it is
        specified that [νn = l], then it also means that

        [n ∈ N ∧ ∃u((u,v) ∈ E ∨ (v,u) ∈ E) ∧ l ∈ N' ∧ ...]

        In other words the structure [G] of the graph G is an invariant
        that is always preserved.

    (** [Make(Node)(Edge)] creates a module that implements [Graph]
        interface and has unlabeled nodes of type [Node.t] and edges
        labeled with [Edge.t]

        In [Core_kernel] basically any type that is reasonable to be
        used as a graph node, satisfies the {!Opaque.S} interface. So,
        a new graph structure can be implemented directly, e.g.,
        {[module G = Graphlib.Make(Int64)(Unit)]}

        If a type doesn't satisfy the [Opaque] interface, then it can
        be easily derived with [Opaque.Make] if [compare] and [hash]
        functions are provided.

        unified, the [Labeled] functor creates a graph data structure,
        where they are different. Moreover, the node label is pure

    (** [to_dot (module G) ~filename:"graph.dot" g] dumps graph [g]
        using [dot] format. This is a customizable version of printing

        [G.to_string] function. Use this function, if you really need
        to customize your output.

        @param graph_attrs a list of global graph attributes;

    (** [depth_first_search (module G) ~init g].  It is the most
        important algorithm of the Graphlib. It builds a forest of
        spanning trees of a graph, classifies graph edges and numbers
        nodes. It is a Swiss-army knife, that is very useful in
        implementing many other algorithms. You can think of this
        function as [fold] on steroids. But unlike [fold], that
        accepts only one function, the [depth_first_search] accepts 5
        different functions, that will be called on different
        situations, allowing you to «fill in the blanks» of your
        algorithm.

        Although [depth_first_search] doesn't allow you to drive the
        walk itself, there're still ways to do this, using {!filtered}
        function. That allows you to hide nodes or edges from the
        walker, thus effectively erasing them from a graph, without
        even touching it.

        @param rev if true, then the graph [g] is traversed in a
        reverse direction. This is essentially the same, as reversing
        the graph, but make sure, that you've adjusted the start
        node.

        @param start if specified, then the traverse will be started
        from the node that is equal to node [start]. Otherwise the
        traverse is started from the first node of a graph as returned
        by [G.nodes], i.e., usually it is an arbitrary node.

        @param start_tree [node] [state] is called on each new spanning
        tree started by the algorithm. If all nodes are reachable from
        the start node, then this function will be called only
        once. If all nodes of a graph are connected, then this
        function, will be called only once.

        @param enter_node [pre] [node] [state] is called when a node
        is first discovered by the traversal. The number is a preorder
        number, also known as depth-first number or [dfnum]. All nodes
        are entered in a pre-order.

        @param leave_node [rpost] [node] [state] is called when all
        successors of a [node] are left (finished). The provided
        number is a reverse post order number, that also defines a
        topological sorting order of a graph. All nodes, are left in
        a post order.

        @param enter_edge [kind] [edge] [state] is called when and
        [edge] is first discovered. Edge kinds are described below.
        The destination of the edge may not be discovered (i.e.,
        entered) yet. But the source is already entered (but not
        finished).

        @param leave_edge [kind] [edge] [state] is called when the
        edge destination is at least started.

        {2 Edges classification}

        An edge in a spanning tree, produced by a depth first walk,
        can belong to one of the following category (kind):
        - Tree edges constitutes a spanning tree [T] of a graph;
        - Forward edges go from an ancestor to a descendants in
          a tree [T];
        - Back edges go from descendants to ancestors in [T],
          including node itself (they are also known as cycle
          edges).
        - Cross edges - all other edges, i.e., such edges for
          which doesn't go from ancestors to descendants or vice
          verse. They are possible since, tree defines only partial
          ordering.

        With respect to a pre-order and reverse post-ordering
        numbering the source [x] and a destination [y] of an edge with
        a given [kind] satisfy to the following inequalities:

        {v
            +---------+-----------------+---------------------+
            | Tree    | pre[x] < pre[y] | rpost[x] < rpost[y] |
            | Forward | pre[x] < pre[y] | rpost[x] < rpost[y] |
            | Back    | pre[x] ≥ pre[y] | rpost[x] ≥ rpost[y] |
            | Cross   | pre[x] > pre[y] | rpost[x] < rpost[y] |
            +---------+-----------------+---------------------+
          v}

        Note: since there can be more than one valid order of
        traversal of the same graph, (and thus more than one valid
        spanning tree), depending on a traversal the same edges can be
        classified differently. With the only exception, that a back
        edge will be always a back edge, disregarding the particular
        order.

        {3 Complexity}

        The algorithm is linear in time. It uses constant stack
        space. In fact, for small graphs it uses stack, but for large
        graphs dynamically switches to a heap storage. The space
        complexity is bounded by linear function of the graph depth.  *)

    (** [dominators (module G) g entry] builds a dominators tree for
        a given graph.

        Definition: a {b walk} is a sequence of alternating nodes and
        edges, where each edge's endpoints are the preceding and
        following nodes in the sequence.

        Definition: a node [v] is {b reachable} if there exists a walk
        starting from [entry] and ending with [v].

        Definition: node [u] {b dominates} [v] if [u = v] or if all walks
        from [entry] to [v] contains [u].

        Definition: node [u] {b strictly dominates} [v] if it dominates
        [v] and [u <> v].

        Definition: node [u] {b immediately dominates} [v] if it
        strictly dominates [v] and there is no other node that
        strictly dominates [v] and is dominated by [u].

        Algorithm computes a dominator tree [t] that has the following
        properties:
        + Sets of graph nodes and tree nodes are equal;
        + if node [u] is a parent of node [v], then node [u]
           immediately dominates node [v];
        + if node [u] is an ancestors of node [v], then node [u]
           strictly dominates node [v];
        + if node [v] is a child of node [u], then node [u]
           immediately dominates node [v];
        + if node [v] is a descendant of node [u], then node [u]
           strictly dominates node [v].

        If every node of graph [g] is reachable from a provided
        [entry] node, then properties (2) - (5) are reversible, i.e.,
        an [if] statement can be read as [iff], and the tree is
        unique.


        {b Lemma}: Everything dominates unreachable block.

        {b Proof}: (by contradiction) suppose there exists a node [u] that
        doesn't dominate unreachable block [v]. That means, that there
        exists a path from [entry] to [v] that doesn't contain
        [u]. But that means, at least, that [v] is reachable. This  is
        a contradiction with the original statement that [v] is
        unreachable. {b Qed.}

        If some nodes of graph [g] are unreachable from the provided
        [entry] node, then they are dominated by all other nodes of a
        graph. It means that the provided system is under constrained
        and has more then one solution (i.e., there exists more than
        one tree, that satisfies properties (1) - (5). In a current
        implementation each unreachable node is immediately dominated
        by the [entry], if the [entry] is in graph.

        To get a post-dominator tree, reverse the graph by passing
        [true] to [rev] and pass exit node as a starting node.

        Note: although it is not imposed by the algotihm, but it is a
        good idea to have an entry node, that doesn't have any
        predecessors. Usually, this is what is silently assumed in
        many program analysis textbooks, but is not true in general
        for control-flow graphs that are reconstructed from binaries *)

      (** [pp_graph ~nodes_of_edge ~nodes ~edges ppf] - generic dot

          This function is useful for implementing custom dot
          printers. Use it if the default dot printer {!Graph.pp}
          doesn't suit your needs.

          For the purpose of this function a graph can be represented
          with three values:
            - [nodes_of_edge] returns the source and destination nodes
              of an edge;
            - [nodes] is a sequence of nodes;
            - [edges] is a sequence of edges;

          @param name the name of the graph.
          @param attrs graphviz attributes of the graph.
          @param string_of_node name of a node.
          @param node_label text representation of the node label.
          @param edge_label text representation of the edge label.

          All optional parameters default to a null value, so that
          if a parameter is not specified, then a corresponding entry
          will not be printed. *)

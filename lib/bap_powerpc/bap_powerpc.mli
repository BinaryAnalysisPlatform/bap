   ## Intro

    This module is the only one that needed to write lifter functions.
    The main idea is to make a life of lifter writers as easy as
    possible. This implies that only a few lines of code should be
    enough to describe any instruction.

    We introduce RTL - the language we expect to be very expressive,
    with lots of details hidden under the hood, so a user should not
    care about minor details.

    So proposed usage is just to open it at the very beginning of your
    module:

    open Bap_powerpc.Std
    ...

    Note, that everywhere in this module, where some operation has
    a notion of bit position (byte/word ...), it's assumed that
    numeration starts from most significant bit (byte/word ...).


   ## Lifter

    Any lifter function must have two arguments.
    The first one is a model of CPU that contains all information like
    registers, memory access, instruction address, etc.
    The second argument is an array of instruction operands, and its
    user responsibility to treat each element of this array
    according to instruction semantics. Those, for add instruction
    which sum register and immediate and save a result in a register,
    a user must point that the first and the second element of
    operands array registers and the third argument is immediate.

    In general, what one should do to add an instruction is to write
    a lifter function and to add it to others.


   ## RTL

    The central part of this module is RTL. It contains expressions,
    operations over expressions and statements.
    Basically, any line that ended with ';' is a statement,
    and any part of it is either expression(s), or operation over
    expression(s).

    ### Bitwidth and Signess
    Any expression in RTL has a notion of signess. Any operation over
    expressions of different sign causes a casting to signed.

    Any expression in RTL has a notion of bitwidth. All operations
    over expressions of different width will cause a casting to the
    more biggest bitwidth.

    Note, that any expression that tends to take part of other
    expression is always unsigned. The same is true for any
    expression that is a concatenation of expressions.
    But it's still possible to use them as signed expressions, e.g.
    assign them to signed expression or use signed comparison.

   ### Expressions
    There are only a few ways to construct expression:
     - from instruction operand
     - from constant
     - from string
     - by defining temporary variable

    To construct an expression that denotes a register and treat
     its content as an unsigned value, one should write:
     ...
     let ra = unsigned reg op.(0)
     ...      -------- --- ------
                 ^      ^    ^
                 |      |    |
      content is |      |    |
      unsigned __|      |    |
                        |    |
           claim register  from operands array at index 0

    Immediate instructions operands are constructed in the same
    way:
     ...
     let im = signed imm op.(1)
     ...

    Also one may create variables for convenience:
     ...
     let x = unsigned var halfword
     ...
    that is a creation of variable of bitwidth 16. Other useful
    bitwidthes are bit, byte, word, doubleword, quadroword. And
    also it's possible to create a variable of arbitrary bitwidth:
     ...
     let x = signed var (bitwidth 10)
     ...

    It's also possible to create an epxression from integer constant:
     ...
     let x = unsigned const word 42
     ...

    And create an expression from string:
     ...
     let x = unsigned of_string "0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF"
     ...

    #### Taking a part
    There is a general way to take a part of an expression:
    {extract exp from to}, where a [from] denotes a more significant
    bit than [to].

    Also, there are few more convenient and readable ways to take a
    part, e.g.:
    low word x  - take the last word from [x]
    high byte x - take first (the most significant) byte
    last x 5    - take last (the least significant) bits
    first x 2   - take second bit
    msb x       - take the most significant bit

    Note, that taking a part of a bigger width from expression is
    also possible. An extended expression will be returned with
    the respect to  [x] sign:
     ...
     let x = unsigned var halfword
     let y = unsigned var word
     RTL.[
        y := last word x;
     ]

    #### Operators
    There are lot's math operators: plus, modulo, less than etc.
    All they take one or more expressions and also return expression:
    x + y, lnot y, x lsl y ...

    #### Assignment
    The only operator that takes an expression and returns a statement
    is an assignment. It is a very important and expressive operator
    in RTL. The right-hand side of an assignment is always treated to
    have the same sign and width as a left one:
    ...
      ra := zero;
      rb := rc ^ rd;
    ...
    Assuming, that zero is just one bit and all ra, rb, rc, rd are 32-bit
    expressions we will get ra, with all bits set to zero, and rb
    equaled to rd.

    An expression in left hand side of assignment is always either of
    expressions:
     - constructed with var/reg constructors
     - expressions from cpu model.
     - taking part or concatenation of listed cases above
    So there are few examples of correct assignment:
     ...
     low byte rt := ra + rb;
     cpu.cr := zero;
     nbit cpu.cr 1 := one;
     ...


   ## Misc

    There are few useful constructions that either a part of RTL
    (if_, foreach) or simplify code (when_, ifnot, switch).
    Also, one needs to register a lifted function, so
    it could be called when appropriative instruction will be
    encountered. There are two operators for this purpose:
    - (>>) - just registers a function (see example below)
    - (>.) - does the same, plus does some extra job (see
             a description below)

   ## Comlete example

    To be more concrete let's create an artificial example:
     1 let sort_of_add cpu ops =
     2   let rt = unsigned reg ops.(0) in
     3   let ra = signed reg ops.(1) in
     4   let im = unsigned imm ops.(2) in
     5   let rc = unsigned reg ops.(3) in
     6   let tm = signed var doubleword in
     7   let xv = unsigned const word 42 in
     8   let sh = unsinged const byte 2 in
     9   RTL.[
    10        rt := ra + im;
    11        tm = cpu.load rt halfword + xv;
    12        rc := (tm lsl sh) + cpu.ca;
    13    ]
    14 let () =
    15   "SomeSortOfAdd" >> sort_of_add;

   There is a lifter for instruction "SomeSortOfAdd". It's required
   it has two arguments: cpu model and operand array.
   An author read an ISA of Power PC architecture carefully and
   figured out that this instruction has four operands, and that the
   first, the second and the fourth argument are registers and the
   third one is an immediate. And instruction has the following
   semantics.
   An effective address is a sum of the content of [ra] register and
   immediate. An effective address is stored in [rt] register. A
   halfword stored at this address must be summed with 42, shifted
   left twice and summed with carry flag. And the result must be
   written to [rc] register.

   How did author implement lifter for this instruction:
   line  1    : defined a function with two arguments
   lines 2-5  : parsed instruction operands
   lines 6-8  : defined useful constants
   lines 9-13 : wrote RTL code for this instruction.
   lines 14-15: registered lifter

   What happens on each line:
   line 10: sum of signed [ra] and unsigned imm is a signed expression,
            because one of the operands is signed. But an unsigned
            result is placed in [rt], since [rt] is unsigned too.
   line 11: load from memory at address from [rt] is summed with 42
            and assigned to variable [tm]. Note, there are two width
            extension under the hood: loaded halfword is extended to
            up to a word bitwidth (since it's a bigger bitwidth among
            sum operand) and than sum extended to a doubleword
            bitwidth with respect to a [tm] sign. So, the result of
            this sum is treated as a signed.
   line 12: Logical shift returns an unsigned result which is summed
            with unsigned value. The interesting part is that it's
            safe to add one-bit value (flag is one bit width) and a
            doubleword.

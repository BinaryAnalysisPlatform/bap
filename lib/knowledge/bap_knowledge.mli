  (** A symbol is an object with unique name.

      Sometimes it is necessary to refer to an object by name, so that
      a chosen name will always identify the same object. Finding or
      creating an object by name is called "interning" it. A symbol
      that has a name is called an "interned symbol". However we
      stretch the boundaries of the symbol idea, by treating all other
      objects as "uninterned symbols". So that any object could be
      treated as a symbol.

      To prevent name clashing, that introduces unwanted equalities,
      we employ the system of packages, where each symbol belongs
      to a package, called its home package. The large system design
      is leveraged due to the mechanism of symbol importing, where the
      same symbol could be referenced from different packages (see
      [import] and [in_package] functions, for more information).

      {3 Symbol syntax}

      The [read] function enables translation of the symbol textual
      representation to an object.  The symbol syntax is designed to
      be verstatile so it can allow arbitrary sets of characters, to
      enable support for modeling different knowledge domains. Only
      two characters has the special meaning for the symbol reader,
      the [:] character acts as a separator between the package and
      the name constituent, and the [\\] symbol escapes any special
      treatment of a symbol that follows it (including the [\\]
      itself). When a symbol is read, an absence of the package is
      treated the same as if the [package] parameter of the [create]
      function wasn't set, e.g.,
      [read c "x"] is the same as [create c "x"], while an empty package
      denotes the [keyword] package, e.g.,
      [read c ":x"] is the same as [create ~package:keyword c "x"].


      {3 Name equality}

      The equality of two names is defined by equality of their
      byte representation. Hence, symbols which differ in register
      will be treated differently, e.g., [Foo <> foo].
  *)
  module Symbol : sig

    (** [intern ?public ?desc ?package name cls] interns a symbol in
        a package.

        If a symbol with the given name is already interned in a
        package, then returns its value, otherwise creates a new
        object.

        If symbol is [public] then it might be advertised and be
        accessible during the introspection. It is recommeneded to
        provide a description string if a symbol is public. Note, a
        non-public symbol still could be obtained by anyone who knows
        the name.

        If the function is called in the scope of one or more
        [in_package pkg<N>], then the [package] parameter defaults to
        [pkg], otherwise it defaults to ["user"]. See also the
        [keyword] package for the special package that holds constants
        and keywords.

        The [desc], [package], and [name] parameters could be
        arbitrary strings (including empty). Any occurence of the
        package separator symbol ([:]) will be escaped and won't be
        treated as a package/name separator.

        the pretty printer, thus [in_package "pkg" @@ Obj.repr buf] will

    (** [import ?strict ?package:p names] imports all [names] into [p].

        The [names] elements could be either package names or
        qualified names. If an element is a package, then all public
        names from this package are imported into the package [p]. If
        an element is a qualified symbol then it is imported into [p],
        even if it is not public in the package from which it is being
        imported.

        If any of the elements of the [names] list doesn't represent a
        known package or known symbol, then a conflict is raised,
        either [Not_a_package] or [Not_a_symbol].

        If [strict] is [true] then no name can change its value during
        the import. Otherwise, if the name is alredy in present in
        package [p] with a different value, then it will be
        overwritten with the new value, i.e., shadowed.

        All names are processed in order, so names imported from
        packages that are in the beginning of the list could be
        shadowed by the names that are in the end of the list (unless
        [strict] is [true], of course). Thus,

        is the same as [import [x;y]].

        Note, all imported names are added as not public.

        If the [package] parameter is not specified, then names are
        imported into the current package, as set by the [in_package]
        function.

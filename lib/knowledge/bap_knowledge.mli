(** The Knowledge Representation Library.

    {2 Introduction}

    The library provides facilities for storing, accumulating, and
    computing knowledge. The knowledge could be represented indirectly,
    in the Knowledge Base, or directly as knowledge values. The
    library focuses on representing knowledge that is partial and
    provides mechanisms for knowledge accumulation and
    refinement. The knowledge representation library leverages the
    powerful type system of the OCaml language to facilitate
    development of complex knowledge representation and reasoning systems.

    {2 Knowledge Taxonomy}

    For a given knowledge system, the domain of discourse is a set of
    objects, optionally partitioned into sorts. Therefore, an {i object}
    is fundamental building block of a knowledge system.

    An object {i class} defines a set of possible properties
    of that objects. A snapshot of all properties of an object is
    called {i value}. A set of values belonging to a particular class
    could be partitioned into sorts, to facilitate the design of
    strongly typed interfaces.

    Properties of objects and values are stored in {i slots}.
    The data type of any property is required to be an instance of the
    {i domain} structure, i.e., it should be a set with a special [empty]
    value and the [order] operation, that orders elements of this set
    by their informational content, so that [empty] is the least
    element.

    The knowledge could be represented directly as a value, or
    indirectly as a set of objects in a knowledge base.


    {2 Values}

    A value is an ordered tuple of slots that holds all properties of
    an object with which this value is associated. Additionally, a
    value is attributed with a sort value, which is shared by all
    values belonging to that sort. The sort value could be a concrete
    value, holding some information that is common for all elements of
    the sort or it could be just a type index that witnesses that the
    value belongs to a certain set of values.

    Properties of a value could be accessed using the [Value.get]
    operator. A new value of a property could be put into the slot
    using the [Value.put] operator.

    Values are instances of the domain type class and therefore a
    property of an object or another value could also be a value.

    The set of slots of a given value is defined by its class, and
    this set is extensible, i.e., it is possible to add more slots.

    {2 Knowledge Base}

    The knowledge base maintains a consistent set of facts about
    object properties. An object is a unit of identity. The value of
    an object is defined by its properties. However, the knowledge
    base doesn't provide the direct access to the object value.

    Object properties could be accessed using the [collect] operator
    and set using the [provide] operator. The knowledge base maintains
    the consistency by disallowing changing an object property to a
    value that has less informational contents than the previous
    value, so that no information is never lost.

    Object properties could also be computed on demand using the
    [promise] operator, which effectively stores a procedure in the
    knowledge base. Several procedures could be provided for a
    property computation, and the procedures themselves could access
    other properties, including the property being computed. The
    knowledge base will ensure that the least fixed point of all
    procedures involved in the property computation is reached.

    All Knowledge Base operators return a computation of type
    ['a knowledge] which is a monad, that denotes a computation that
    is knowledge dependent, i.e., it either accesses the knowledge
    base, or modifies it, or both.

    The knowledge computation may lead to an inconsistent state, in
    other words, it is not guaranteed that the computation will reach
    the normal form. A diverging computation will yield a value of
    type [conflict] when run.

    To prevent unnecessary conflicts, it is possible to represent
    object properties as opinions instead of facts. Opinions are facts
    that are attributed with the name of an agent that provided this
    fact. In case if mutiple agents provide conflicting opinions, the
    [resolve] operator will compute the consensus, based on agents
    predefined trustworthiness. Opinions are introduced using the
    [suggest] operator or promised using the [propose] operator.

    Finally, the knowledge base is partially persistent. It is
    possible to make some slots persistent, so that properties, stored
    in them are preserved between program runs.

  (** Orders knowledge by its information content.

      [Order.partial] is a generalization of the total order,
      which is used to compare the amount of information in two
      specifications of knowledge.

      Note: The information content of a value ordering shall not be
      confused with any other intrinsic ordering of the associated value
      type. For example, if we will take age, measured in natural numbers,
      then the order natural numbers has nothing to do with the amount
      of information associated with each age. From the knowledge
      representation perspective. We either do not know the age, or
      know it to some certainty. Therefore, the domain representation
      could be either [int option], with [None] being the minimal
      element (denoting an absence of knowledge about the age of an
      object) or [Some x], s.t.,
      [order (Some x) (Some y) = NC iff x <> y], i.e., neither is
      having more or less knowledge than another.

  (** Class is a collection of sorts.

      A class [k] is denoted by an indexed type [(k,s) cls], where
      [s] is a sort.

      A class denotes a set of properties that describe objects and
      values of the given class. Thus, a class fully defines the
      structure of an object or a value. Sorts could be used to
      further partition the class into subsets, if needed.

      Classes are declarative and each class should have a unique
      name. To prevent name clashing the Knowledge Library employs a
      Common Lisp style namespaces, where each name belongs to a
      package.

      The type index, associated with the class, should be protected
      by the module that declares the class. For example, it is a bad
      idea to use the [unit] type as an index of a class.

  *)
  module Class : sig
    type (+'k,'s) t = ('k,'s) cls


    (** [declare name sort] declares a new
        class with the given [name] and [sort] index.

        Since classes are declarative each new declaration creates a
        new class that is not equal to any other.

        The [package] and [name] pair should be unique. If there is
        already a class with the given [package:name] then the
        declaration fails.

        @param public (defaults to false) if specified, then the
        class will referenced in the Knowledge documentation output.

          | Some t -> Object.cast t x y
          | _ -> ...

        (e.g., constrained by the module signature), but has to be
        recreated. The [let T = assert_equal x y] expression,
        establishes a type equality between objects in the typing
        context, so there is no need to invoke [Object.cast].

        {[
          let add : value obj -> value obj -> value obj = fun x y ->
            let T = assert_equal bitv value in

        The returned slot can be used to access the declarated
        property. If the property is expected to be public then it
        should be published via a library interface.

        will be used to persist the property.

        @param desc is a property documentation.

        returned by [scope] evaluates to a value. The identity of an

        Dereference of the null object (e.g., using [collect]) always
        returns an empty denotation. Any information stored in the
        object is forgotten (discarded). Promises are never run on the

  (** Knowledge Values.

      A value is a concrete representation of knowledge. It is a
      snapshot of all properties associated with some object, i.e., an
      ordered tuple of slots. The value has no identity and that
      differs it from the object, as the value is essentially a
      property of an object - not an object itself.

      From another perspective, a value is an extensible record, with
      fields reified into first-class slots, the record type into the
      [cls] values, and an additional constraint that all field types
      must be an instance of the domain type class (i.e., have a
      default and an ordering).

      Each value has a class. The class value itself is indexed with
      the class and sort indices. The first index denotes the set of
      properties that could be associated with the value. The second
      index further partitions values of that class into subsets, to
      so that domain specific relations between values could be
      expressed explicitly with the host language type system.

      The value sort is an arbitrary value, which can also be used to
      store additional static information about the value, i.e., the
      information that is common to all instances of the sort.


      {3 Total ordering and age}

      In addition to be partially ordered by their information
      content, values are also totally ordered, so that they could be
      organized into finite sets and maps.

      The total order is induced from the information order, so that
      if a value [x] is ordered before [y] in the information order,
      then it will be also ordered before [y] in the total order. And
      if [x] and [y] have the same information content, then they are
      considered equal. Values with non-comparable information content
      are ordered by their time-stamp.

      Every time a new value created it is assigned a
      time-stamp. A new value is created by all functions that has
      ['a value] return type, except the [refine] function. Each
      time-stamp is unique and no two values could have the same
      time-stamps unless they are physically the same, or are
      de-serializations of the same value, or are refinements of the
      same value. In other words, values with equal time-stamps are
      guaranteed to bear the same information.

      Time-stamp values correlate with the order of evaluation. A
      value that was evaluated more recently will have a higher
      time-stamp. Therefore time-stamps define an age of a value. A
      value which has a smaller time-stamp is younger than a value
      that has a larger time-stamp.

        {3 Conflict resolution strategies}

        The following conflict resolution strategies are currently
        supported (more strategies could be added later):

        - [`drop_old] a conflicting property of an older object is
          ignored (an object is older if its time-stamp is less than
          or equal the time-stamp of other object);
        - [`drop_new] a conflicting property of the newer object is

  (** A symbol is an object with a unique name.

      Sometimes it is necessary to refer to an object by name, so that
      a chosen name will always identify the same object. Finding or
      creating an object by name is called "interning" it. A symbol
      that has a name is called an "interned symbol". However we
      stretch the boundaries of the symbol idea, by treating all other
      objects as "uninterned symbols". So that any object could be
      treated as a symbol.

      To prevent name clashing, that introduces unwanted equalities,
      we employ the system of packages, where each symbol belongs
      to a package, called its home package. The large system design
      is leveraged due to the mechanism of symbol importing, where the
      same symbol could be referenced from different packages (see
      [import] and [in_package] functions, for more information).

      {3 Symbol syntax}

      The [read] function enables translation of the symbol textual
      representation to an object.  The symbol syntax is designed to
      be verstatile so it can allow arbitrary sets of characters, to
      enable support for modeling different knowledge domains. Only
      two characters has the special meaning for the symbol reader,
      the [:] character acts as a separator between the package and
      the name constituent, and the [\\] symbol escapes any special
      treatment of a symbol that follows it (including the [\\]
      itself). When a symbol is read, an absence of the package is
      treated the same as if the [package] parameter of the [create]
      function wasn't set, e.g.,
      [read c "x"] is the same as [create c "x"], while an empty package
      denotes the [keyword] package, e.g.,
      [read c ":x"] is the same as [create ~package:keyword c "x"].


      {3 Name equality}

      The equality of two names is defined by equality of their
      byte representation. Hence, symbols which differ in register
      will be treated differently, e.g., [Foo <> foo].
  *)
  module Symbol : sig

    (** [intern ?public ?desc ?package name cls] interns a symbol in

        If a symbol with the given name is already interned in a

        If symbol is [public] then it might be advertised and be
        accessible during the introspection. It is recommeneded to
        provide a description string if a symbol is public. Note, a
        non-public symbol still could be obtained by anyone who knows
        the name.

        If the function is called in the scope of one or more

        an element is a qualified symbol then it is imported into [p],
        even if it is not public in the package from which it is being
        imported.

        If any of the elements of the [names] list doesn't represent a

  (** Partially ordered sets with the least element.

      The Domain is fundamental structure for the Knowledge
      representation as domains are used to represent property
      values. Basically, all information is represented with
      domains. Domains capture the idea of partial information or
      an approximation of information.

      A domain is a set equipped with the partial order, which orders
      elements of this set by their information content, and the least
      element [empty] or [bot], which is not greater than any other
      element of this set. The [empty] element indicates an absence of
      knowledge.

      The resulting structure is not strictly a domain, the only
      missing element is the maximal element. The role of the is taken
      by values of type conflict, which denote the [top] element
      equipped with the diagnostic information. Therefore, type
      [('a,conflict) result] is a directed-complete partial order, or
      a Scott-Ershov domain, or just a domain..

      The domain structure is very general and the [join] operator is
      induced by the specified [order]. However, it is possible to
      upgrade the structure, used to represent a property, to lattice
      or lattice-like structure, by providing a custom [join] function.

        the least possible value in the chain, etc. It's only required
        that for all possible values [x], [empty <= x], where [<=]
        is the partial order defined by the [order] parameter

        The [order] function defines the partial order for the given
        domain, such that
        - [partial x y = LT] iff [x<=y && not(y <= x)]

        - [partial x y = NC] iff [not (x <= y) && not (y <= x)].

        The optional [inspect] function enables introspection, and may
        return any representation of the domain value.

        The returned value is an instance of the domain type class
        that is used for declaration of a property. The instance is

        used only for introspection and better error messages.

        won't be treated as a separator neither it will break
        anything.

        ["user"] package.
    *)
    val create : ?package:string -> string -> t

    (** [read ?package input] reads a full name from input.

        This function will parse the [input] and return a
        fully-qualified name that corresponds to the input, using
        [package] as the currently opened package. The input syntax
        is {v
          name = string, ":", string
               | ":", string
               | string
          string = ?a sequence of any characters?
        v}


        Not all characters in the [input] string are treated
        literally, the following two characters have a special
        interpretation:
        - ['\\'] the escape character;
        - [':'] the package separator character.

        The escape character disables a special interpretation of the
        consequent character. The package separator denotes the place
        in the input where the package name ends and the name part
        starts.

        If [package] is specified then it is treated literally (as in
        the [create] function). The same as in [create] it defaults to
        the ["user"] package.

        If [input] doesn't denote a fully qualified name (i.e., there
        is no [':'] special character in [input], then the read name
        is qualified with the passed [package], otherwise the package
        is defined by the [input].

        The function is expected to work with the output of the [show]
        function, so that for all [n], [read (show n) = n]. However,
        it is robust enough to accept any user inputs, even if it is
        not a well-formed input, e.g., when an escape character is
        used to escaped a non-special character or when input contains
        more than one unescaped separators. In case of invalid input,
        all special characters that doesn't make sense are treated
        literally and the first special [':'] denotes the end of the
        package field. If the input is not valid, then it is possible
        that [show (read s) <> s], since the output of [show] is
        always valid, e.g.

        [show@@read "hello:cruel:world" = "hello:cruel\\:world"]

  (** An extensible enumerated type.

      An enumerated type is a set of names that are represented

      The enumerated type had to be declared before used and is
      commonly referenced as a module declared constant. It is
      possible, however to reference the enumerated type value using
      its string representation, via the [read] function.

  (** {3 Rules}

      Rules are used for introspection and documentation. A rule is a
      specification of a promise and consists of the following parts

      - a unique rule name,
      - an optional sequence of external dependencies,
      - an optional sequence of inputs,
      - the output,
      - the documentation string.

      {3 Examples}

      Suppose, we have a system that describes personal information,

      {[
        type person
        type address

        val first_name : (person, string option) slot
        val last_name : (person, string option) slot
        val full_name : (person, string option) slot

        val address : (person, address option) slot
        val phone : (person, phone option) slot
      ]}

      The simplest and obvious rule would a derivation of the full
      name from the first and last names. This derivation could be
      encoded as a promise. To make this promise visible and known
      to the users of the knowledge system we advertise it as a rule,

      {[
        Rule.(declare "full-name" |>
              require first_name  |>
              require last_name   |>
              provide full_name   |>
              comment "full = first last");
        promise full_name @@ fun person ->
        collect first_name >>=? fun first ->
        collect last_name >>|? fun last ->
        first ^ " " ^ last
      ]}


      The rule above is a closed term, since it doesn't reference any
      language variables, i.e., it derives its output directly from
      the knowledge base. Such rules are called static as they are
      always available. Contrary, dynamic rules are provide external
      information to the knowledge system. For example, the following
      rule extracts the phone number of a person from the online database,

      {[
        let provide_phone_base =
          Rule.(declare "lookup-phone-number" |>
                dynamic ["phone-base"] |>
                require full_name |>
                provide phone |>
                comment "lookups phone in the public database");
          fun base ->
            promise phone @@ fun person ->
            collect full_name >>| fun name ->
            Phonebase.lookup base phone
      ]}

      The [dynamic] operator of the specification accepts a list of
      formal parameters of the rule. In theory, this list could be
      empty. In that case, the rule will still be treated as dynamic.

      Note, that in the example above, the rule declaration is not
      parametrized with the base. Otherwise, it will be only declared
      after the base is available. Moreover, each new application will
      create a new rule, which will end up in a runtime failure, since
      the rule name should be unique.

      This module defines an domain-specific language for specifying
      rules. The [Documentation] and [Documentation.Rule] modules
      could be used to introspect all available rules.

    (** a term of type [doc] expects [|> comment <doc>].
        This is the only way to finish a rule definition. *)
    type doc


    (** [declare ?package name] starts a rule definition.

        The rule definition should be followed by zero or more

          zero or more dynamic parameters specifications,
        - [|> dynamic <parameters>],

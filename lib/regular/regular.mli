(** Interface that should support any regular data type.

    {2 Overview}

    A regular type is catch all term for all data types that are
    regular, like numbers, characters, strings and their algebraic
    closure. A proper term for such types would be inductive types. A
    regular type always has a concrete representation, it is
    printable, comparable (with total order), hashable, etc.

    To contrast, functions, closures, proxies, descriptors, and any
    co-inductive types are non-regular. The main difference, is that
    regular type is self contained, where non-regular types, usually
    represent something that can be only observed, but not really
    represented with the data type.

    On the border line we have [Opaque] data types. These are types,
    that pretend to be [Regular], but we can't actually inspect their
    representation.


    {2 Features}

    So what the library actually provides. First of all it defines the
    {!Regular} interface, that each regular data type is expected to
    implement. This includes a full set of [Io] functions, that allows
    one to read, write and serialize values of the type (see {!Data}
    interface). It also provides an inteface for creating different
    collections from the values of that type, including trees,
    hashtables, maps, sets, etc. Also, it describes the whole algebra
    of comparison functions. For the opaque data types an interface
    called {!Opaque} is provided, that is a proper subset of the
    {!Regular}. It doesn't provide printing and serialization, but has
    everything that can be derived for a type with a total order
    (e.g., containers, comparison function, etc).

    A functor is provided for each interface, that requires the
    minimal implementation, and derives the rest.

    Finally, a {!Bytes} module is provided that facilitates the
    transfer from mutable to immutable {!Strings}. It is the extension
    of OCaml standard Bytes module, enhanced with the expected set of
    functions.

      generic way.

      To be on a safe side, we insist on explicit versioning of each
      data representation. Otherwise, any OCaml value is suitable for
      this module.

      The module defines interfaces {!Data.S} that describes the
      expected set of functions for data. It also defines a {!Cache.S}
      interface, that is useful for caching data that is hard to
      obtain.*)

        function for outputting.  *)
    val pretty_writer : (module Pretty_printer.S with type t = 'a) -> 'a writer


    (** Data type interface.

        Types that implement this interface have a concrete
        representation, that can be serialized and deserialized.

        The only requirement is to provide a [version] value, that
        represents a version number of the representation. Every time
        the representation changes, the version should be incremented.

        The interface allows to implement more than one format and
        several versions of the same format. By default, the OCaml
        Marshal format is used.

        All [Regular] modules include this interface. The [Regular]
        modules provide [sexp] and [bin_io] formats in addition to
        the [Marshal]. They may provide more formats.

        {3 Example}

        Given a module [Bil] that implements [Regular] interface, it
        is possible to read a value of type [Bil.t] as simple, as:

        {[
          let prog = Bil.Io.read filename
        ]}
    *)
    module type S = sig

      (** type constructor  *)
      type t

      (** [name,Ver v,desc] information attached to a particular
          reader or writer.  *)
      type info = string * [`Ver of string] * string option

      (** Data representation version. After any change in data
          representation the version should be increased.

          Serializers that are derived from a data representation must have
          the same version as a version of the data structure, from which
          it is derived. This kind of serializers can only read and write
          data of the same version.

          Other serializers can actually read and write data independent
          on its representation version. A serializer, that can't store
          data of current version simply shouldn't be added to a set of
          serializers.

          It is assumed, that if a reader and a writer has the same name
          and version, then whatever was written by the writer should be
          readable by the reader. The round-trip equality is not required,
          thus it is acceptable if some information is lost.

          It is also possible, that a reader and a writer that has the
          same name are compatible. In that case it is recommended to use
          semantic versioning.*)

        val print : ?ver:string -> ?fmt:string -> Format.formatter -> t -> unit

      end

      (** Data cache.

          Store and retrieve data from cache. The cache can seen as a
          persistant weak key-value storage. Data stored here can
          disappear at any time, but can survive for a long time
          (outliving the program). The library by itself doesn't provide
          a caching service for any type, only the interface. The
          caching service can be added externally (e.g., via a plugin).

          The caching infrastructure provides only facilities for
          storing and loading data. In fact this is just a weak
          key-value storage. A weak, because storage is allowed to
          to loose data.

          As a key, we use [digest] that is underneath the hood is and
          md5 sum of arguments used to build the cached data.

          Let's take for example a function that builds some control
          flow graphs. It has three parameters, one is an optional
          [debug], that doesn't affect the algorithm, and the rest two
          has type [string] and [int] correspondingly. The following
          code will try to load result from a cache, using a digest of
          the arguments, and if is not available, the the graph will be
          computed and stored in the cache. This function will work even
          if there is no caching service. Of course, there will be no
          benefits, since the [save] function will just immediately
          forget its argument.

          {[
            let compute_graph ?(debug=false) x y : Graphs.Cfg.t =
              let digest =
                Data.Cache.digest ~namespace:"example" "%s%d" x y in
              match Graphs.Cfg.Cache.load digest with
              | Some g -> g
              | None ->
                let g = build_graph ?debug x y in
                Graphs.Cfg.Cache.save digest g;
                g
          ]}

          Note: it is only reasonable to use caching for data types,
          that take significant amount of time to create.

        used improperly, they can break the immutability invariant on
        strings provided by the [-safe-string] option. They are available for
        expert library authors, but for most purposes you should use the
        always-correct {!Bytes.to_string} and {!Bytes.of_string} instead. *)
    module Unsafe : sig

      (** [to_string b] - unsafely converts a byte sequence into a string.

          To reason about the use of [to_string], it is convenient to
          consider an "ownership" discipline. A piece of code that
          manipulates some data "owns" it; there are several disjoint ownership
          modes, including:
          - Unique ownership: the data may be accessed and mutated
          - Shared ownership: the data has several owners, that may only
            access it, not mutate it.

          Unique ownership is linear: passing the data to another piece of
          code means giving up ownership (we cannot write the
          data again). A unique owner may decide to make the data shared
          (giving up mutation rights on it), but shared data may not become
          uniquely-owned again.

          [to_string s] can only be used when the caller owns the byte
          sequence [s] -- either uniquely or as shared immutable data. The
          caller gives up ownership of [s], and gains ownership of the
          returned string.

          There are two valid use-cases that respect this ownership
          discipline:

          1. Creating a string by initializing and mutating a byte sequence
          that is never changed after initialization is performed.

          {[
            let string_init len f : string =
              let s = Bytes.create len in
              for i = 0 to len - 1 do Bytes.set s i (f i) done;
              Bytes.Unsafe.to_string s
          ]}

          This function is safe because the byte sequence [s] will never be
          accessed or mutated after [to_string] is called. The
          [string_init] code gives up ownership of [s], and returns the
          ownership of the resulting string to its caller.

          Note that it would be unsafe if [s] was passed as an additional
          parameter to the function [f] as it could escape this way and be
          mutated in the future -- [string_init] would give up ownership of
          [s] to pass it to [f], and could not call [to_string]
          safely.

          We have provided the {!String.init}, {!String.map} and
          {!String.mapi} functions to cover most cases of building
          new strings. You should prefer those over [to_string] or
          [to_string] whenever applicable.

          2. Temporarily giving ownership of a byte sequence to a function
          that expects a uniquely owned string and returns ownership back, so
          that we can mutate the sequence again after the call ended.

          {[
            let bytes_length (s : bytes) =
              String.length (Bytes.Unsafe.to_string s)
          ]}

          In this use-case, we do not promise that [s] will never be mutated
          after the call to [bytes_length s]. The {!String.length} function
          temporarily borrows unique ownership of the byte sequence
          (and sees it as a [string]), but returns this ownership back to
          the caller, which may assume that [s] is still a valid byte
          sequence after the call. Note that this is only correct because we
          know that {!String.length} does not capture its argument -- it could
          escape by a side-channel such as a memoization combinator.

          The caller may not mutate [s] while the string is borrowed (it has
          temporarily given up ownership). This affects concurrent programs,
          but also higher-order functions: if [String.length] returned
          a closure to be called later, [s] should not be mutated until this
          closure is fully applied and returns ownership. *)
      val to_string : t -> string

      (** [of_string s] - unsafely converts a shared string to a byte
          sequence that should not be mutated.

          The same ownership discipline that makes [to_string]
          correct applies to [of_string]: you may use it if you were
          the owner of the [string] value, and you will own the return
          [bytes] in the same mode.

          In practice, unique ownership of string values is extremely
          difficult to reason about correctly. You should always assume
          strings are shared, never uniquely owned.

          For example, string literals are implicitly shared by the
          compiler, so you never uniquely own them.

          {[
            let incorrect = Bytes.Unsafe.of_string "hello"
            let s = Bytes.of_string "hello"
          ]}

          The first declaration is incorrect, because the string literal
          ["hello"] could be shared by the compiler with other parts of the
          program, and mutating [incorrect] is a bug. You must always use
          the second version, which performs a copy and is thus correct.

          Assuming unique ownership of strings that are not string
          literals, but are (partly) built from string literals, is also
          incorrect. For example, mutating [of_string ("foo" ^ s)]
          could mutate the shared string ["foo"] -- assuming a rope-like
          representation of strings. More generally, functions operating on
          strings will assume shared ownership, they do not preserve unique
          ownership. It is thus incorrect to assume unique ownership of the
          result of [of_string].

          The only case we have reasonable confidence is safe is if the
          produced [bytes] is shared -- used as an immutable byte
          sequence. This is possibly useful for incremental migration of
          low-level programs that manipulate immutable sequences of bytes
          (for example {!Marshal.from_bytes}) and previously used the
          [string] type for this purpose. *)

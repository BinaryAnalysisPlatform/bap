  (** {2 Overview}

      {3 Layered Architecture}

      The BAP library has the layered architecture consisting of four
      layers. Although the layers are not really observable from outside
      of the library, they make it easier to learn the library as they
      introduce new concepts sequentially. On top of these layers, the
      {{!section:project}Project} module is defined that consolidates
      all information about a target of analysis. The [Project] module
      may be viewed as an entry point to the library.

      v}

      The {{!bfl}Foundation library} defines {{!Bil}BAP Instruction
      language} data types, as well as other useful data structures,
      like {!Value}, {!Trie}, {!Vector}, etc. The
      {{!section:image}Memory model} layer is responsible for loading
      and parsing binary objects and representing them in a computer
      memory. It also defines a few useful data structures that are
      used extensively by later layers, e.g., {!Table} and
      {!Memmap}. The next layer performs
      {{!section:disasm}disassembly} and lifting to BIL. Finally, the
      {{!section:sema}semantic analysis} layer transforms a binary
      into an IR representation, that is suitable for writing
      analysis.

      {3 Plugin Architecture}

      The standard library tries to be as extensible as possible. We
      are aware, that there are not good solutions for some problems, so
      we don't want to force our way of doing things. In short, we're
      trying to provide mechanisms, not policies. We achieve this by
      employing the dependency injection principle. By inversing the
      dependency we allow the library to depend on a user code. For
      example, a user code can teach the library how to disassemble
      the binary or even how to reconstruct the CFG. In fact, the
      library by itself doesn't contain the disassembler or lifter, or
      any architecture specific code. Everything is injected later by
      corresponding plugins.

      The library defines a fixed set of extension points. (Other
      libraries, that constitute the Platform and follow the same
      principle, can define their own extension points, so the
      following set is not complete):

      - loader - add new file formats (see {!Image.register_backend} or {!Project.Input});
      - target - add new architecture (see {!register_target});
      - disassembler - plug in a disassembler (see 'disasm.hpp' for c++ disassembler interface);
      - attributes - extend the attribute type ({!Value.Tag.register});
      - symbolizer - add names to functions (see {!Symbolizer});
      - rooter - find function starts (see {!Rooter});
      - brancher - resolve jump destinations (see {!Brancher})
      - reconstructor - CFG reconstruction algorithm (see
        {!Reconstructor});
      - analysis - write your own arbitrary analysis pass (see
        {!Project.register_pass})

      The {!Regular.Std} library, that forms a foundation for the BAP
      Standard Library, also follows the dependency injection
      principle, so every data type that implements regular interface,
      can be dynamically extended with:

      - pretty printing function;
      - serialization subroutines;
      - caching.

      {3 Writing the analysis}

      A common use case, is to write some analysis that will take the
      program in some representation and then either output result of
      analysis in a human or machine readable way, or transform the
      program, in a way that can be employed by other
      analysis. Following a naming convention of a more established
      community of compiler writers, we name such analysis a _pass_.

      The library itself doesn't run any analysis, it part of the job of a
      frontend to run it. In particular, the [bap] frontend, will run
      the analyses based on a command line specification. See [bap
      --help] for more information.

      We use {!Project} data structure to represent a program and all
      associated knowledge that we were capable to infer.  To learn
      how to use the project data structure continue to
      {!section:project}.
  *)

  (** {2:bfl Foundation Library}

      At this layer we define ({{!Bil}Binary Instruction language})
      and few other useful data structures:

      - {{!Arch}arch} - describes computer architecture;
      - {{!Size}size} - word and register sizes;
      - {{!Var}var}  - {{!Bil}BIL} variable;
      - {{!Type}typ} - {{!Bil}BIL} type system;
      - {{!Exp}exp}  - {{!Bil}BIL} expression sub-language;
      - {{!Stmt}stmt} - {{!Bil}BIL} statements;
      - {{!Bitvector}bitvector} - a bitvector data structure
        to represent immediate data, used usually by their aliases {!word} and {!addr};
      - {{!Value}value} - an extensible variant type;
      - {{!Dict}dict} - an extensible record;
      - {{!Vector}vector} - an array that can grow;
      - {{!Trie}Trie} - prefix trees;

      Most of the types implement the {{!Regular.Std.Regular.S}Regular}
      interface. This interface is very similar to Core's
      [Identifiable], and is supposed to represent a type that is as
      common as a built-in type. One should expect to find any
      function that is implemented for such types as [int], [string],
      [char], etc.  Namely, this interface includes:

      - comparison functions: ([<, >, <= , >= , compare, between, ...]);
      - each type defines a polymorphic [Map] with keys of type [t];
      - each type provides a [Set] with values of type [t];
      - hashtable is exposed via [Table] module;
      - hashset is available under [Hash_set] name
      - sexpable and binable interface;
      - [to_string], [str], [pp], [ppo], [pps] functions
        for pretty-printing.

      It is a convention, that for each type, there is a module with
      the same name that implements its interface. For example, type
      [exp] is a type abbreviation for [Exp.t], and module [Exp]
      contains all functions and types related to type [exp]. For
      example, to create a hashtable of statements, just type:

      [let table = Exp.Table.create ()]

      If a type is a variant type (i.e., it defines constructors) then
      for each constructor named [Name], there exists a corresponding
      function named [name] that will accept the same number of
      arguments as the arity of the constructor (also named a
      _functional constructor_). For example, a [Bil.Int] can be
      constructed with the [Bil.int] function that has type [word ->
      exp]. If a constructor has several arguments of the same type we
      usually disambiguate using labels, e.g., [Bil.Load of
      (exp,exp,endian,size)] has function {{!Bil.load}Bil.load} with
      type: [mem:exp -> addr:exp -> endian -> size -> exp]

      {3:value Value}

      {{!Value}Universal values} can be viewed as extensible variants on
      steroids. Not only they maybe extended, but they also can be
      serialized, compared with user-defined comparison function and
      even pretty printed.

      {3:dict Dict}

      Like {{!Value}value} is an extensible sum type, {{!Dict}dict}
      can be viewed as an extensible product type. Dict is a sequence
      of values of type {!value}, with {{!Value.Tag}tags} used as
      field names. Of course, fields are unique.

      {3:vector Vector}

      {!Vector} is an implementation of C++ STL like vectors with
      logarithmic push back.

      {3:tries Tries}

      The Foundation library also defines a prefix tree data structure
      that proves to be useful for binary analysis applications.
      {{!module:Trie}Trie}s in BAP is a functor that derives a
      polymorphic trie data structure for a given
      {{!modtype:Trie.Key}Key}.

      For convenience we support instantiating tries for most of
      our data structures. For example, {{!Bitvector}Word} has several
      {{!Bitvector.Trie}tries} inside.

      For the common string trie, there's {!Trie.String}.  *)

  (** {2:image Memory model}

      This layer is responsible for the representation of binaries. It
      provides interfaces for the memory objects:

      - {{!Memory}mem} - a contiguous array of bytes, indexed with
        absolute addresses;

      - {{!Table} 'a table} - a mapping from a memory regions to
        arbitrary data (no duplicates or intersections);

      - {{!Memmap}a memmap} - a mapping from memory region to
        arbitrary data with duplicates and intersections allowed, aka
        segment tree or interval map;

      - {{!Image}image} - represents a binary object with all its
        symbols, segments, sections and other meta information.

      The [Image] module uses the plugin system to load binary
      objects. In order to add new loader, one should implement the
      {{!Backend}Backend.t} loader function and register it with the
      {{!Image.register_backend}Image.register_backend} function. *)

  (** {2:disasm Disassembler}

      This layer defines the interfaces for disassemblers. Two interfaces
      are provided:

      - {{!Disasm}Disasm} - a regular interface that hides all
        complexities, but may not always be very flexible.
      - {{!Disasm_expert}Disasm_expert} - an expert interface that
        provides access to a low-level representation. It is very
        flexible and fast, but harder to use.

      To disassemble files or data with the regular interface, use
      one of the following functions:

      - {!Disasm.of_mem} - to disassemble a region of memory;
      - {!Disasm.of_image} - to disassemble a loaded binary object;
      - {!Disasm.of_file} - to disassemble file.

      All these functions perform disassembly by recursive descent,
      reconstruct the control flow graph, and perform lifting.

      The result of disassembly is represented by the abstract value
      of type {{!Disasm}disasm}. Two main data structures that are
      used to represent disassembled program are:

      - {{!Insn}insn} - a machine instruction;
      - {{!Block}block} - a basic block, i.e., a linear sequence of
        instructions.

      The following figure shows the relationship between basic data
      structures of the disassembled program.

      {v
        +-----------------+

        | |   disasm    | |

        | |    block    | |

        | |     stmt    | |
        | +-------------+ |
        +-----------------+
      v}

      A disassembled program is represented as a set of interconnected
      {{!Block}basic blocks}, called a whole program control flow
      graph (CFG) and it is indeed represented as a graph
      {!Graphs.Cfg}.  See {{!Graphlib.Std}graphlib} for more
      information on graphs.

      Each block is a container to a sequence of machine
      instructions. It is guaranteed that there's at least one
      instruction in the block, thus the {{!Block.leader}Block.leader}
      and {{!Block.terminator}Block.terminator} functions are total.

      Each {{!Insn}machine instruction} is represented by its
      [opcode], [name] and [array] of operands (these are machine and
      disassembler specific), a set of predicates (that approximates
      instruction semantics on a very high level), and a sequence of
      {{!Bil}BIL} statements that precisely define the semantics of
      the instruction.

      The expert interface exposes low level interface that provides
      facilities for building custom implementations of
      disassemblers. The interface to the disassembler backend is
      exposed via the {!Disasm_expert.Basic} module. New backends can
      be added by implementing the 'disasm.hpp' interface.

      Modules of type {{!CPU}CPU} provide a high level abstraction of
      the machine CPU and allow one to reason about the instruction
      semantics independently from the target platform. The module
      type {{!Target}Target} brings [CPU] and [ABI] together. To get
      an instance of this module, you can use the
      {{!target_of_arch}target_of_arch} function. Architecture
      specific implementations of the [Target] interface may (and
      usually do) provide more information, see corresponding support
      libraries for {!ARM} and {{!X86_cpu}x86} architectures.
  *)

  (** {2:sema Semantic Analysis}

      On the semantic level the disassembled program is lifted into
      the BAP Intermediate Representation (BIR). BIR is a
      semi-graphical representation of BIL (where BIL represents a
      program as Abstract Syntax Tree). The BIR provides mechanisms to
      express richer relationships between program terms and it also
      easier to use for most use cases, especially for data dependency
      analysis.

      The program in IR is build of terms. In fact the program itself
      is also a term. There're only 7 kinds of terms:

      - {{!Program}program} - the program in whole;
      - {{!Sub}sub} - subroutine;
      - {{!Arg}arg} - subroutine argument;
      - {{!Blk}blk} - basic block;
      - {{!Def}def} - definition of a variable;
      - {{!Phi}phi} - phi-node in the SSA form;
      - {{!Jmp}jmp} - a transfer of control.

      Unlike expressions and statements in BIL, IR's terms are {e
      concrete entities}.  Concrete entity is such entity that can
      change in time and space, as well as come in and out of
      existence.  Contrary, {e abstract entity} is eternal and
      unchangeable.  {e Identity} denotes the sameness of a concrete
      entity as it changes in time.  Abstract entities don't have an
      identity since they are immutable.  Program is built of concrete
      entities called terms.  Terms have {e attributes} that can
      change in time, without affecting the identity of a term.
      Attributes are abstract entities.  In each particular point of
      space and time a term is represented by a snapshot of all its
      attributes, colloquially called {e value}.  Functions that
      change the value of a term in fact return a new value with
      different set of attributes.  For example, [def] term has two
      attributes: left hand side (lhs), that associates definition
      with abstract variable, and right hand side (rhs) that
      associates [def] with an abstract expression. Suppose, that the
      definition was:

      {[
        # let d_1 = Def.create x Bil.(var y + var z);;
        val d_1 : Def.t = 00000001: x := y + z
      ]}

      To change the right hand side of a definition we use
      [Def.with_rhs] that returns the {e same} definition but with
      {e different} value:

      {[
        # let d_2 = Def.with_rhs d_1 Bil.(int Word.b1);;
        val d_2 : Def.t = 00000001: x := true
      ]}

      [d_1] and [d_2] is different values

      {[
        # Def.equal d_1 d_2;;
        - : bool = false
      ]}  of the same term {[
        # Term.same d_1 d_2;;
        - : bool = true
      ]}

      The identity of this terms is denoted by the term identifier
      ([tid]). In the textual representation term identifiers are
      printed as ordinal numbers.

      Terms, can contain other terms. But unlike BIL expressions or
      statements, this relation is not truly recursive, since the
      structure of program term is fixed: [arg], [phi], [def], [jmp]
      are leaf terms; [sub] can only contain [arg]'s or [blk]'s; [blk]
      consists of [phi], [def] and [jmp] sequences of terms, as
      pictured in the figure below.  Although, the term structure is
      closed to changes, you still can extend particular term with
      attributes, using [set_attr] and [get_attr] functions of the
      {{!Term}Term} module. This functions are using {{!Value}extensible
      variant} type to encode attributes.

  (** {2:project Working with project}

      There're two general approaches to obtain a value of type
      {{!Project}project}:
      - create it manually using {!Project.create} function;
      - write a plugin to the [bap] frontend.

      Although the first approach is simplistic and gives you a full
      control, we still recommend to use the latter.

      To write a program analysis plugin (or pass in short) you need to
      implement a function with one of the following interfaces:

      - [project -> project] and register it with
        {{!Project.register_pass}register_pass};
      - [project -> unit] and register it with
         {{!Project.register_pass'}register_pass'};

      Once loaded from the [bap] frontend (see [bap --help]) this
      function will be invoked with a value of type
      {{!Project.t}project} that provides access to all information
      gathered from the input source. If the registered function
      returns a non [unit] type, then it can functionally update the
      project state, e.g., add annotations, discover new symbols,
      transform program representation, etc.

      {4 Example}

      The following plugin prints all sections in a file:

      {[
        open Core_kernel

      {3 Passing information between passes}

      To pass data from one pass to another in a type safe manner, we
      use {{!Value}universal values}. Values can be attached to a
      particular memory region, IR terms, or put into the [storage]
      dictionary. For the first case we use the {{!Memmap}memmap} data
      structure.  It is an interval tree containing all the memory
      regions that are used during analysis. For the [storage] we use
      [Dict] data structure. Also, each program term, has its own
      dictionary.

      {3 Memory annotations}

      By default the memory is annotated with the following attributes:

      - {{!Image.section}section} -- for regions of memory that had a
        particular name in the original binary. For example, in ELF,
        sections have names that annotate a corresponding memory
        region. If project was created from memory object, then the
        overall memory will be marked as a ["bap.user"] section.

      - {{!Image.segment}segment} -- if the binary data was loaded
        from a binary format that contains segments, then the
        corresponding memory regions are be marked. Segments provide
        access to permission information.  *)

      {2 Overview }

      A numeric value with the 2-complement binary representation. It
      is good for representing addresses, offsets and other arithmetic
      values.

      Each value is attributed by a bitwidth and signedness. All
      arithmetic operations over values are done modulo their
      widths. It is an error to apply arithmetic operation to values
      with different widths. Default implementations will raise a an
      exception, however there exists a family of modules that provide
      arithmetic operations lifted to an [Or_error.t] monad. It is
      suggested to use them, if you know what kind of operands you're
      expecting.

      {2 Clarification on size-morphism }

      Size-monomorphic operations (as opposed to size-polymorphic
      comparison) doesn't allow to compare two operands with different
      sizes, and either raise an exception or return [Error]. If we would
      have a type safe interface, with type [t] defined as [type 'a t],
      where ['a] stands for size, then size-monomorphic operations will
      have type ['a t -> 'a t -> _], and size-polymorphic ['a t -> 'b t -> _].

      By default, size-polymorphic comparison is used. To understand
      the ordering relation one can think that a lexical ordering is
      specified on a tuple [(x,n)], where [x] is the number and [n] is
      the size. For example, the following sequence is in an ascending
      order:

      {[ 0x0:1, 0x0:32, 0x0:64, 0x1:1, 0x1:32, 0xD:4, 0xDEADBEEF:32]}.

      A size-monomorphic interfaced is exposed in a [Mono] submodule. So
      if you want a monomorphic map, then just use [Mono.Map] module.
      Note, [Mono] submodule doesn't provide [Table], since we cannot
      guarantee that all keys in a hash-table have equal size.

      {2 Clarification on signs}

      By default all numbers represented by a bitvector are considered
      unsigned. This includes comparisons, e.g., [of_int (-1)
      ~width:32] is greater than zero. If you need to perform a signed
      operation, you can use the [signed] operator to temporary cast
      your value to the signed kind.  We use word "temporary" to
      emphasize that, the signedness property won't propagate to the
      result of the operation, e.g. result of the following
      expression: [Int_exn.(signed x / y)] will not be signed. In other
      words each new value is created unsigned.

      If any operand of a binary operation is signed, then a signed
      version of an operation is used, i.e., the other operand is
      upcasted to the signed kind.

      Remember to use explicit casts, whenever you really need a signed
      representation. Examples:
      {[
        let x = of_int ~-6 ~width:8
        let y = to_int x          (* y = 250 *)
        let z = to_int (signed x) (* z = ~-6 *)
        let zero = of_int 0 ~width:8
        let p = x < zero          (* p = false *)
        let q = signed x < zero   (* p = true *)
      ]}

      {2:bv_string Clarification on string representation }

      As a part of [Identifiable] interface bitvector provides a pair of
      complement functions: [to_string] and [of_string], that provides
      facilities to store bitvector as a human readable string, and to
      restore it from string. The format of the representation is the
      following (in EBNF):
      {[
        repr  = [sign], [base], digit, {digit}, ":", size, [kind]
          sign  = "+" | "-";
        base  = "0x" | "0b" | "0o";
        size  = dec, {dec};
        digit = dec | oct | hex;
        dec   = ?decimal digit?;
        oct   = ?octal digit?;
        hex   = ?hexadecimal digit?;
        kind  = u | s
      ]}

      Examples:
      [0x5D:32s, 0b0101:16u, 5:64, +5:8, +0x5D:16].

      If [base] is omitted base-10 is assumed. If the kind is omitted,
      then the usigned kind is assumed. The output format is always in
      a hex representation with a full prefix.  . *)

    (** {2 Common Interfaces}

        be a key in a dictionary, etc. Moreover, being a number it can
        be compared with zero and applied to a common set of integer
        operations.  *)

  (** Main BIL module.

      The module specifies Binary Instruction Language (BIL). A language to
      define a semantics of instructions. The semantics of the BIL
      language is defined at [[1]].

      The language is defined using algebraic types. For each BIL
      constructor a smart constructor is defined with the same (if
      syntax allows) name. This allows to use BIL as a DSL embedded
      into OCaml:

      {[Bil.([
          v := src lsr i32 1;
          r := src;
          s := i32 31;
          while_ (var v <> i32 0) [
            r := var r lsl i32 1;
            r := var r lor (var v land i32 1);
            v := var v lsr i32 1;
            s := var s - i32 1;
          ];
          dst := var r lsl var s;
        ])]}

      where [i32] is defined as
      [let i32 x = Bil.int (Word.of_int ~width:32 x)]
      and [v,r,s] are some variables of type [var]; and
      [src, dst] are expressions of type [exp].

    (** Value of a result.
        We slightly diverge from an operational semantics by allowing

        In operational semantics a storage is represented
        syntactically as
        {v
            v1 with [v2,ed] : nat <- v3,
      v}
        where v1 may be either a [Bot] value, representing an empty

           | bot : memory
           | store : (mem : memory) (addr : value) (data : value).
      v}

        That is equivalent to an assoc list. Although we provide an
        assoc list as storage variant (see {!Storage.linear}), the
        default storage is implemented slightly more effective, and
        uses linear space and provides $log(N)$ lookup and update
        methods. Users are encouraged to provide more efficient
        storage implementations, for interpreters that rely heave on
        memory throughput.

        an integer operation is applied to expressions of different

  (** BIL variable.

      A variable is a symbolic name, that may have different values
      during program evaluation. A variable may be virtual, in the
      sense that it doesn't correspond to some physical location, or it
      can be physical if a variable is a some physical location, e.g.,
      a register. All variables have types that designate a set of
      values over which a variable ranges.

      BIL variables are regular values. Variables can have
      indices. Usually the index is used to represent the same
      variable but at different time or space (control flow path).
      This is particularly useful for representing variables in SSA
      form.

      By default, comparison function takes indices into account. In
      order to compare two variables regardless their index use [same]
      function, or compare with [base x].

      (** Expression interpreter.

          Expi is a base class for all other interpreters (see {!bili}
          and {!biri}, that do all the hard work. Expi recognizes a
          language defined by [exp] type. It evaluates arbitrary
          expressions under provided {{!Context}context}.

          To create new interpreter use operator [new]:

          {v
        let expi = new expi;;
        val expi : _#Expi.context expi = <obj>
        v}

          Note: The type [_#Expi.context] is weakly polymorphic subtype of
          [Expi.context][1]. Basically, this means, that the type is not
          generalized and will be instantiated when used and fixed
          afterwards.

          {v
        let r = expi#eval_exp Bil.(int Word.b0 lor int Word.b1);;
        val r : _#Expi.context Bil.Result.r = <abstr>
        v}

          The returned value is a state monad parametrized by a subtype
          of class [Expi.context]. The state monad is a chain of
          computations, where each computation is merely a function from
          state to a state paired with the result of computation. The
          state is accessible inside the computation and can be
          changed.

          To run the computation use [Monad.State.eval] function, that
          accepts a state monad and an initial value. Here we can
          provide any subtype of [Expi.context] as an initial
          value. Let start with a [Expi.context] as a first approximation:

          {v
        let x = Monad.State.eval r (new Expi.context);;
        val x : Bil.result = [0x3] true
        v}

          The expression evaluates to [true], and the result is tagged
          with an identifier [[0x3]]. The [Exp.context] assigns a unique
          identifier for each freshly created result. Tag [[0x3]] means
          that this was the third value created under provided context.

          If the only thing, that you need is just to evaluate an
          expression, then you can just use [Exp.eval] function:

          {v
        Exp.eval Bil.(int Word.b0 lor int Word.b1);;
        - : Bil.value = true
        v}

          The main strength of [expi] is its extensibility. Let's write
          a expression evaluator that will record a trace of evaluation:

          {[
            class context = object
              inherit Expi.context
              val events : (exp * Bil.result) list = []
              method add_event exp res = {< events = (exp,res) :: events >}
              method show_events = List.rev events
            end
          ]}

          {[
            class ['a] exp_tracer = object
              constraint 'a = #context
              inherit ['a] expi as super
              method! eval_exp e =
                let open Monad.State in
                super#eval_exp e >>= fun r ->
                get () >>= fun ctxt ->
                put (ctxt#add_event e r) >>= fun () ->
                return r
            end;;
          ]}

          Note : We made our [exp_tracer] class polymorphic as a
          courtesy to our fellow programmer, that may want to reuse it.
          We can define it by inheriting from [expi] parametrized with
          our context type, like this: [inherit [context] expi]

          Also, there is no need to write a [constraint], as it will be
          inferred automatically.

          Now, let's try to use our tracer. We will use
          [Monad.State.run] function, that returns both, the evaluated
          value and the context. (We can also use [Monad.State.exec], if
          we're not interested in value at all):

          {v
        let expi = new exp_tracer;;
        val expi : _#context exp_tracer = <obj>
        # let r = expi#eval_exp Bil.(int Word.b0 lor int Word.b1);;
        val r : _#context Bil.Result.r = <abstr>
        # let r,ctxt = Monad.State.run r (new context) ;;
        val r : Bil.result = [0x3] true
        val ctxt : context = <obj>
        ctxt#events;;
        - : (exp * Bil.result) list =
        [(false, [0x1] false); (true, [0x2] true); (false | true, [0x3] true)]
        v}

          [1]: The weakness of the type variable is introduced by
          a value restriction and can't be relaxed since it is invariant
          in state monad.

  (** Effect analysis.

      Effect analysis describes how an expression computation
      interacts with the outside world. By the outside world we
      understand the whole of the CPU state (including the hidden
      state) and the memory. We distinguish, so far, between the
      following sorts of effects:

      - coeffects - a value of an expression depends on the outside
        world, that is further subdivided by the read effect, when an
        expression reads a CPU register, and the load effect, when an
        expression an expression accesses the memory.

      - effects - a value modifies the state of the world, by either
        storing a value in the memory, or by raising a CPU exception
        via the division by zero or accessing the memory.

      An expression that doesn't have effects or coeffects is
      idempotent and can be moved arbitrary in a tree, removed or
      substituted. An expression that has only [coeffects] is
      generative and can be reproduced without a significant change
      of semantics.

      Examples:
      - [x ^ x], [x+1], [x] - have coeffects;
      - [x[y]] - has both effects (may raise pagefault) and coeffects;
      - [7 * 8], [42] - have no effects.

        but if it is not computed, then it is proved that it is not
        possible for the expression to have this effect.

        The analysis applies a simple abstract interpretation to
        approximate arithmetic and prove an absence of the division
        by zero. The load/store/read analysis is more precise than
        the division by zero, as the only source of the imprecision
        is a presence of conditional expressions.

        Requires: normalized and simplified expression.

        the type system.

        [enter_C], [visit_C], [leave_C]. The default implementation for
        [enter_C] and [leave_C] is to return its argument. The default

        the tree.

        The following code simplification are applied:

        - constant folding: if an expression can be computed
          statically then it is substituted with the result of
          computation, e.g., [1 + 2 -> 3]

        - neutral element elimination: binary operations with one of
          the operands being known to be neutral, are substituted with
          the other operand, e.g., [x * 1 -> x]

        - zero element propagation: binary operations applied to a
          zero element are substituted with the zero element, e.g.,
          [x * 0 -> 0]

        - symbolic equality reduction: if both branches of a
          comparison are syntactically equal then the comparison is
          reduced to a boolean constant, e.g., [a = a -> true],
          [a < a -> false]. Note, by default a read from a register is
          considered as a (co)effect, hence the above transformations
          wouldn't be applied, consider passing [~ignore:[Eff.reads]]
          if you want such expressions to be reduced.

        - double complement reduction: an odd amount of complement
          operations (one and two) are reduced to one complement of
          the same sort, e.g., [~~~1 -> ~1]

        - binary to unary reduction: reduce a subtraction from zero
          to the unary negation, e.g., [0 - x -> -x]

        - exclusive disjunction reduction: reduces an exclusive
          disjunction of syntactically equal expressions to zero, e.g,
          [42 ^ 42 -> 0]. Note, by default a read from a register is
          considered as a (co)effect, thus [xor eax eax] is not
          reduced, consider passing [~ignore:[Eff.reads]] if you want

    (** [normalize ?normalize_exp xs] produces a normalized BIL
        program with the same[^1] semantics but in the BIL normalized
        form (BNF). There are two normalized forms, both described
        below. The first form (BNF1) is more readable, the second form
        (BNF2) is more strict, but sometimes yields a code, that is hard
        for a human to comprehend. The [BNF1] is the default, to request
        [BNF2] pass [normalize_exp:true].

        Precondition: [xs] is well-typed.

        The BIL First Normalized Form (BNF1) is a subset of the BIL
        language, where expressions have the following properties:

        - Memory load expressions can be only applied to a memory. This
          effectively disallows creation of temporary memory regions,
          and requires all store operations to be committed via the
          assignment operation. Also, this provides a guarantee, that
          store expressions will not occur in integer assignments, jmp
          destinations, and conditional expressions, leaving them valid
          only in an assignment statement where the rhs has type mem_t.
          This is effectively the same as make the [Load] constructor to
          have type ([Load (var,exp,endian,size)]).

        - No load or store expressions in the following positions:
          1. the right-hand side of the let expression;
          2. address or value subexpressions of the store expression;
          3. storage or address subexpressions of the load expression;

        The BIL Second Normalized Form (BNF2) is a subset of the BNF1
        (in a sense that all BNF2 programs are also in BNF1). This form
        puts the following restrictions:

        - No let expressions - new variables can be created only with
          the Move instruction.

        - All memory operations have sizes equal to one byte. Thus the
          size and endianness can be ignored in analysis. During the
          normalization, the following rewrites are performed
        {v
       let x = <expr> in ... x ... => ... <expr> ...
       x[a,el]:n => x[a+n-1] @ ... @ x[a]
       x[a,be]:n => x[a] @ ... @ x[a+n-1]
       m[a,el]:n <- x => (...((m[a] <- x<0>)[a+1] <- x<1>)...)[a+n-1] <- x<n-1>
       m[a,be]:n <- x => (...((m[a] <- x<n-1>)[a+1] <- x<n>)...)[a+n-1] <- x<0>
       (x[a] <- b)[c] => m := x[a] <- b; m[c]
      v}

        [^1]: The normalization procedure may duplicate expressions
        that might be considered non-generative. For example,

        [let x = m[a] in x + x]

        is rewritten to [m[a] + m[a]]. Given a concrete semantics of a
        memory (for example, if memory is mapped to a device register
        that changes every times it is read) this expression may have
        different value. It will also have different effect (such as
        two memory accesses, page faults etc).

        However, in the formal semantics of BAP we do not consider
        effects, and treat all expressions as side-effect free, thus the
        above transformation, are preserving the semantics.

        @param normalize_exp (defaults to [false]) if set to [true] then
        the returned program will be in BNF2.

  (** Universal Values.

      This module creates an extensible variant type, that resembles
      extensible variant types, introduced in 4.02, but even more safe
      and more extensible, and, what really matters,
      serializable. Basically you should think of [Value.t] as a union
      type, aka sum type, that can be extended in any place, including
      your plugin code. Where extending is adding new constructor. To
      add new constructor, you need to register it, e.g.,

      {[
        let function_signature = Value.Tag.register (module String)
            ~name:"function_signature"
            ~uuid:"2175c28c-08ca-4052-8385-3a01e1c6ab6f"
      ]}

      This is merely equivalent to adding a branch

      {[
        | Function_signature of string
      ]}

      to existing union type. The main difference is that the [name]
      shouldn't be unique (in fact [name] doesn't bear any semantic
      meaning, it basically for pretty-printing). On the other hand
      the [uuid] parameter must be unique across the universe, space
      and time. To get the UUID with such properties, you can use
      [uuidgen] program that is usually available on Linux and Mac OS.

      [name] and [uuid] must be strings, known at compile time, in
      other words it must be string literal, not just an arbitrary
      string, created dynamically. This is made intentionally, in
      order to prevent the abuse of the system.

      The [(module String)] syntax creates a value from the module
      [String], (so called first-class module). The module should
      implement [Value.S] signature, that requires pretty-printing,
      comparison function and serialization.

      {[
        module type S = sig
          type t with bin_io, compare, sexp

          val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
        end
      ]}

      The good news is that, most of the types in [Core] and [Bap] do
      conform with the requirements. Usually, one can implement the
      requirements very easily by using type-driven syntax extensions
      (although, you still need to implement pretty-printing function
      yourself):

      {[
        module Loc = struct
          type t = string * int * int
          with bin_io, compare, sexp

          let pp ppf (file,line,col) =
            Format.fprintf ppf "%s:%d:%d" file line col
        end

        let loc = Value.Tag.register (module Loc)
            ~name:"loc"
            ~uuid:"400e190e-ce21-488d-87b1-c101709621a8"
      ]}

      The returned value, is a tag that can be used to constructed
      values of that branch, and to deconstruct (extract) them. You
      may think of it as a cipher key, that is used to package data
      into the value container, and later to unpack it:

      {[
        # let main_pos = Value.create loc ("test.c", 20, 2);;
        val main_pos : value = test.c:20:2
      ]}

      You may see, that OCaml pretty-prints the value. That's neat!
      Also, you may see, that the returned expression has type
      [value]. That means that it can be used uniformly with other
      values, for example, you can put them in one container, e.g.,

      {[
        # let main_t = Value.create function_signature
              "void main(int argc, const char *argv[])";;
        val main_t : value = void main(int argc, const char *argv[])
      ]}

      {[
        # let main = [main_pos; main_t];;
        val main : value list = [
            test.c:20:2;
            void main(int argc, const char *argv[])
          ]
      ]}

      To extract value you can use [Value.get] function:

      {[
        # Value.get loc main_pos;;
        - : Loc.t option = Some ("test.c", 20, 2)
      ]}

      This will require an extra allocation of an [option] container,
      and in a performance critical context it may be unacceptable.
      For this special case you can use a more efficient:

      {[if Value.is loc then Value.get_exn loc main_pos]}.

      Underneath the hood, the values of type [value] is just a pair
      of an original value and runtime type information.

      The comparison of two values of type [value] is actually a
      multi-method, as it has the following behavior:

      1. If both values has the same type, then use [compare]
       function, that was provided for this type.
      2. If values are of different types, that are known to
       the type system, then compare them using RTTI, and ignore the
       value.
      3. If at least one of the values is of the unknown type,
       (i.e., type wasn't registered in the type system), then
       use polymorphic compare on a tuple of UUID and binary
       representation of the values.

      The rules above guarantee, that values with different RTTI id
      are never equal. It also guarantees that the ordering will be
      preserved between different builds of a program, and even
      between different versions of the compiler.

      {2 Thread safety}

      The only thread unsafe function is [register], that should be
      called in the module initialization time. In general programs
      modules are initialized in a single thread, so this shouldn't be
      an issue.  The implementation by itself doesn't call [register].

  (** Table.

      Tables are used to partition memory region into a set of
      non-intersecting areas. Each area is associated with arbitrary
      value of type ['a] bound to the type of the table.

      All operations over tables are purely applicative, i.e. there is
      no observable side-effects. Although, they employ some kind of
      caching underneath the hood, so that they perform better if
      they're  build once and used many times.

      Tables can be also linked. For example, if you have two tables
      mapping the same memory region to a different sets of values, you
      can create a mapping from one set of values to another. See [link]
      function for mode details. *)

    (** [link relation t t1 t2] takes two tables and returns a mapping

        Parameter [t] specifies a [hashable] typeclass of the type ['a]. If
        type ['a] implements [Hashable] interface, then you can obtain it
        with [hashable] function, e.g. [Int.hashable] with return the
        appropriate type class. If ['a] doesn't implement [Hashable], then
        it can be implemented manually.

        Relation specifies the multiplicity of the relation between
        entities from table [t1] to entities from table [t2], and is
        summarized below:

        - [one_to_many] means that a particular region from table [t1] can
          span several memory regions from table [t2]. Example: segments
          to symbols relation.

        - [one_to_one] means that for each value of type ['a] there is
          exactly one value of type ['b]. This relation should be used with
          caution, since it is quantified over _all_ values of type
          ['a]. Indeed, it should be used only for cases, when it can be
          guaranteed, that it is impossible to create such value of type
          ['b], that has no correspondence in table [t2]. Otherwise,
          [one_to_maybe_one] relation should be used. Example: llvm
          machine code to assembly string relation.

        - [one_to_maybe_one] means that for each value in table [t1] there
          exists at most one value in table [t2]. Example: function to
          symbol relation.

        {3 Examples}

    (** [rev_map arity t tab] creates a reverse mapping from values of
        typeclass [t] stored in table [tab] to memory regions.

        Note. not every mapping is reversible, for example, trying to obtain
        a reverse of surjective mapping as a one-to-one mapping will
        result in an error. But surjective mappings can be reversed
        using [~one_to:many] mapping. A particular example of surjective
        mapping is [symbol] tables, in a case when functions can occupy
        several non-contiguous regions of memory.

        For example, to create a mapping from a function symbol to
        sequence of memory regions with it code:

        {[rev_map one_to:many Sym.hashable tab]}

    *)

    (** {2 Iterators}

        This section provides a common set of iterators. Note: name
        iterator is used in a functional meaning, i.e., an iterator is a
        function that takes a data structure and another function, and
        applies it to all elements in some manner.

        All iterators share some common part of interface that was lifted
        to a ['a ranged] type. When you see

        [('a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool) ranged]

        just mentally substitute it with:

        [?start -> ?until -> 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool].

        In other words ['f ranged] just prepends [?start -> ?until ->] to
        function with type ['f] (do not forget that ['f] can be an arrow
        type).

        [start] and [until] parameters narrows iteration to some
        subset of table. If they are unspecified then iteration would
        be performed on all table entries in an ascending order of
        addresses. If they are specified, then if [start <= until],
        then iteration will be performed in the same order but on a
        specified subset. In the case, when [start > until], iteration
        will be performed in a decreasing order.  *)

          memory [mem]. The process of disassembly can be driven using
          the [stop], [step], [back] and [jump] functions, described
          later.

          @param backlog defines a size of history of states, that can
          be used for backtracking. Defaults to some positive natural
          number.

          @param stop_on defines a set of predicates that will be
          checked on each step to decide whether a disassembler should
          stop here and call the user-provided [hit] function, or it should
          continue. The decision is made according to the rule: [if
          exists stop_on then stop], i.e., it there exists such
          predicate in a set of predicates, that evaluates to true, then
          stop the disassembly and pass the control to the user function
          [hit].  A few notes: only valid instructions can match
          predicates, and if the set is empty, then it always evaluates
          to false.

          @param init initial value of user data, that can be passed
          through handlers (cf., [fold])

          @param return a function that lifts user data type ['s] to type
          ['r]. It is useful when you need to perform disassembly in some
          monad, like [Or_error], or [Lwt]. Otherwise, just use [ident]
          function and assume that ['s == 'r].

          The disassembler will invoke user provided callbacks. To each
          callback at least two parameters are passed: [state] and
          [user_data]. [user_data] is arbitrary data of type ['s] with
          which the folding over the memory is actually
          performed. [state] incapsulates the current state of the
          disassembler, and provides continuation functions, namely
          [stop], [next] and [back], that drives the process of
          disassembly. This functions are used to pass control back to
          the disassembler.

          [stopped state user_data] is called when there is no more data to
          disassemble. This handler is optional and defaults to [stop].

          [invalid state user_data] is an optional handler that is called on
          each invalid instruction (i.e., a portion of data that is not a
          valid instruction), it defaults to [step], i.e., to skipping.

          [hit state mem insn data] is called when one of the predicates
          specified by a user was hit. [insn] is actually the instruction
          that satisfies the predicate. [mem] is a memory region spanned by
          the instruction. [data] is a user data. [insn] can be queried for
          assembly string and kinds even if the corresponding modes are
          disabled.  *)

        A property or a semantic tag is some kind of attribute
        associated with an instruction. Usually a property is a
        boolean, it either holds or not. In our case we employ modular
        logic, and a property can have an intermediate state between
        true and false. That means, that we have two kinds of
        relations, strong "must" and weaker "may".  The [must]
        property is known to be a property associated with the
        instruction. It is a strong knowledge. For example, if an
        instruction has [jump] property, then it is guaranteed to be a
        jump instruction. On the other hand, the [may] property
        represent some uncertain knowledge. For example, the [load]
        property is [may] as it designates that an instruction may
        access the main memory, or may not access, as it depends on some
        information, that cannot be deduced statically.  *)

      - there is no known jump in the program, that points to an
        instruction that is not a leader of a basic block;

      in {{!Graphlib.Std}graphlib} library, e.g.,

      {[
        module G = Graphs.Cfg

        let insns cfg =
          Graphlib.reverse_postorder_traverse (module G) cfg |>

    module Callgraph : Graph with type node = tid
                              and type Node.label = tid
                              and type Edge.label = jmp term list

    (** Graph view over IR.

        This module implements a graph view on an intermediate
        representation of a subroutine. To create an instance of a
        graph, using existing subroutine use {!Sub.to_cfg}. At any
        moment current sub term can be obtained using {!Sub.of_cfg}
        function. This is a just a projection operation, so it doesn't
        take any computing time.

        All [Graph] modification operations, like [insert], [remove]
        and [update] in [Node] and [Edge] modules are mapped to
        corresponding [Term] operations. Also, for performance
        reasons, graph is augmented with auxiliary data structures,
        that performs most of the operations in O(log(N)) time.

        Although this implements all operations of {!Graph} interface
        it is recommended to use {!Term} or [Builder] interfaces to
        build and modify underlying terms. The next few sections will
        clarify the behavior of a graph when it is modified using
        {!Graph} interface. If you do not want to read the following
        sections, then better do not use this module to build your
        terms.

        {2 Inserting nodes}

        When node is inserted into a graph [g] all jumps of a node,
        that lead to blocks that are already in a graph will be
        represented as edges. Also, all jumps from other nodes to the
        inserted node, will be added as edges (assuming that this
        other nodes are also in the graph g). Thus inserting node can
        create an arbitrary number of edges, from zero to N. If jump
        target is not yet in the graph, then jump is not removed from a
        sequence of jumps of the inserted node, but just ignored.

        {2 Updating nodes}

        When node is updated with the same node (but possibly with
        different set of terms, see {{!sema}description of sameness})
        then all changes that affects control flow will be
        applied. For example, if jump is absent in a new version of a
        block, and this jump corresponds to an edge in the graph, then
        this edge will be removed.

        {2 Removing nodes}

        The node will be removed from the underlying [sub term], and
        all edges incident to the removed node will be also removed.
        This will not affect jmp terms of blk terms.

        {2 Inserting edges}

        Edges in IR graph represents a transfer of a control flow
        between basic blocks. The basic block in IR is more reach,
        rather then a node in a graph. For example, in blk term the
        order of jumps matters. Jump [n] is taken, only if guard
        conditions of jumps [0] to [n-1] evaluated to [false] (like
        switch statement in C language). The order of edges in a graph
        is unspecified. So, some precaution should be taken, to handle
        edge removing and inserting correctly. Each edge is labeled
        with abstract label, that represents the jump position in a
        graph.

        When an edge is created it will look for corresponding jumps
        in source node. If there exists such jump, and it points to
        the destination, then it will be left untouched. If it points
        to a different node, then it will be fixed to point at the
        a given destination. If there is no position in a slot,
        represented by the a given label, then it will be
        inserted. Dummy jumps will be prepended before the inserted
        jump, if needed.

        When an edge is inserted into the graph, then source and
        destination nodes are inserted or updated (depending on whether
        they were already present in the graph). As a result, the
        graph must contain at least nodes, incident to the edge, and
        the edge itself.

        {2 Updating edge}

        Updating an edge is basically the same, as updating incident
        nodes, a given that the edge exists in the graph.

        {2 Removing edge}

        Removing an edge is not symmetric with edge insertion. It
        doesn't remove the incident nodes, but instead removes jumps
        from the source node to destination. The jumps are removed
        accurately, so that the order (and semantics) is preserved. If
        the removed jump was in the middle of the sequence then it is
        substituted by a dummy jump with [false] guard.

  (** The interface to the disassembler level.

      The following definitions are used in documentation of modules
      and functions in this interface.

      An {i instruction} is a sequence of consecutive bytes that has
      known decoding in the given instruction set architecture
      (ISA). The following semantic properties of an instruction, as
      provided by ISA specification. In the definitions below the
      following properties play an important role
      (see {!Insn.property} for more details about the properties):
      - [call];
      - [jump].

      An {i instruction address} is the address of the first byte of
      the instruction.

      A [jump] instruction {i destination} is an address defined by
      ISA specification to which the control flow should transfer if
      the jump is taken. Potentially, it is possible that the
      destination of a jump instruction follows the instruction, but
      otherwise, the instruction that follows the instruction is not
      the destination, only destinations of the {i taken} jump are
      considered to be in the set of destinations of an instruction.

      An instruction is a {i conditional} [jump] if it is a [jump]
      instruction that is not always taken, as defined by the ISA
      specification.

      An instruction is a {i barrier} if it a [jump] that is not a
      [call] and is not conditional.

      An {i execution order}, is an order in which CPU executes
      instructions.

      The {i linear order} of a sequence of instructions is the
      ascending order of their addresses.

      An instruction is {i delayed} by [m > 0] instructions if it takes
      effect not immediately but after [m] other instructions are
      executed.

      An instruction [i(k)] {i follows} the instruction [i(j)] if
      [i(j)] is not a barrier and either the address of [i(k)] is
      the successor of the address of the last byte of [i(j)] or if
      either [i(k+m)] or [i(k)] is an instruction that is delayed
      by [m > 0] instructions.

      A {i chain of instructions} is a sequence of instruction
      [{i(0); ...; i(k),i(k+1),i(n)}] so that i(k+1) is either
      a resolved destination of [i(k)] or follows it. An instruction
      can belong to more than one chain.

      A {i valid chain of instructions} is a chain where the last
      instruction is a [jump] instruction that is either indirect or
      its destinations belong to some previous jump in the same
      chain.

      An instruction is {i valid} if it belongs to a valid chain of
      instructions.

      A byte is {i data} if one the following is true:
      1) its address is an address of an instruction that is not valid;
      2) it was classified in the knowledge base as data;
      3) it is not an instruction.

      A {i basic block} is an non-empty instruction chain
      [{i(1); ... i(n)}] such that for each [1 < i <= n],
      - [i(i)] follows [i(i-1)];
      - there is no valid instruction in the knowledge base that has
        [i(i)] as a known destination;
      - [i(i)] is not a jump when [i < n].

      A {i subroutine} is a non-empty finite set of basic blocks
      [{b(1); ..; b(n)}] such that [b(1)] dominates each block in
      [{b(2); ..; b(n)}] (which also implies that they are
      reachable) and [b(1)] is called the {i entry} block (or point).
  *)
  module Disasm : sig

    (** Disassembler Driver.

        This is a low-level interface to the CFG reconstruction and
        disassembling engine. It is used by BAP's high-level
        components, such as the recursive-descent disassembler, so
        there is in general no need to use it directly, unless you're
        devising a custom disassembly pipe-line.


        The disassembler is driven and controlled by the knowledge
        base, so it is possible to modify the behavior of the BAP
        disassembler layer through the knowledge base and turn the
        default recursive-descent mode into something more
        conservative, e.g., speculative, superset, shingled, or even
        probabilistic disassembler.

        {3 Algorithm}

        {4 Memory Classification}

        When the driver is fed with a new memory region (using the
        {!Driver.scan} function), it uses the knowledge base to
        initially classify addresses that belong to this region.

        For each byte in the region, it creates a temporary
        [core-theory:program] object and sets is [label-address]
        property to the address of that byte. It then queries if it is
        a function start ([core-theory:is-function]) and if it is
        known to be code or data (if the [core-theory:is-valid]
        property is [(true)] then it is classified as code and if it
        [(false)] then it is data, otherwise, it is undetermined). All
        objects created during classification are deleted immediately
        after the query and never committed to the knowledge base
        (they are scoped objects). Therefore it is fine to speculate
        and assume that all bytes are code by providing [(true)] to
        the [is-valid] property of each byte.


        {4 Disassembling}

        The disassembling starts from each function start (as
        identified by the previous step) and continues until there is
        no more unprocessed function starts and all addresses, which
        were classified as code, are either successfully disassembled
        or proved to be data.

        During disassembling the driver will discover more jump
        destinations and add them to the worklist. The default mode is
        speculative, i.e., when we meet a barrier, we continue
        disassembling beyond it. If the worklist is empty, but the set
        of addresses that were classified as code (in the first step)
        is still not empty, which means that these addresses are not
        reachable from the initially provided starting points
        (function starts) then the minimal address is extracted from
        the set and is assumed to be a start of a basic block and
        added to the worklist.

        The process continues until both the worklist and the set of
        code addresses are empty. When the process converges the
        knowledge base will contain all disassembled instructions
        (though some of them might be invalid). The result of the
        disassembly is the value that contains information sufficient
        to reconstruct the control-flow graph of the program. It could
        be queried directly, using various accessors or folded over
        with the [explore] function, which is a generalized
        control-flow graph building function.

        {4 Backtracking}

        The disassembler has a backtracking mechanism that enables it
        to track each disassembled byte back to the memory byte that
        was initially marked as code or a function start. When we
        identify an instruction chain that is invalid, i.e., when data
        follow a machine instruction or when its destination is some
        data, we retract the whole chain of instructions. This ensures
        that all valid instructions belong to at least one valid
        instruction chain. The justification for not including invalid
        instructions chains into the disassembly is that such chains
        will unconditionally switch the CPU into the invalid
        instruction state which will terminate the program. Since such
        a chain can't include system calls or CPU exceptions (both are
        not barriers) it can't have any side-effects visible outside
        of the process so it could be safely ignored.

        {4 Delay slots}

        Any instruction could have a delay ([core-theory:delay]) that
        is greater than zero. In that case the execution order of the
        instructions will not be equal to the linear order of the
        instructions addresses and [m] instructions that follow the
        delayed instruction will be executed before that instruction
        (put in the basic block before it), where [m] is the size of
        the delay slot, expressed in instructions.

          The following syntactic forms are used in propagation rules:

          [*a <- v] - store value [v] at address [a];
          [exp ~> v] - expression reduces to value [v];

          [<bop>] - BIL binary operation or BIL concat expression;
          [<uop>] - BIL unary, extract or cast expression.

          {3 Rules}

          Value [v] is tainted by taint [t], denoted as [v -> t], if there
          exists a deriviation of the following rules, proving this fact.

          {v

    *a ~> v
    a -> t
    ---------------- :: p_load
    v -> t

    *a <- v

          Note 1: this class overrides only methods, that computes non-leaf

          Note 2: we do not propagate taint from condition to branches in the
          if/then/else expression, since we're propagating only data
          dependency, not control dependency.

          Although, one can argue, that in expression [if c then x else y]
          the result depends on [c], since if we change [c] we will get
          different results, there is a good reason for not propagating this
          dependency - the consistency with BIR and BIL. Consider, BIL's
          [if] statement or BIR's conditional jump. If we will start to
          propagate taint from condition in [ite] expression, then we should
          also propagate it in BIL's and BIR's conditionals. Unfortunately
          the latter is not possible.

  (** The interface to the BAP toplevel state.

      To create a project from the binary code BAP relies on the
      knowledge base, which is a state monad underneath the hood,
      or, put it simply, each knowledge computation is a function
      of type [state -> state * 'a]. To enable backward compatibility,
      we compute each such stateful computation in the toplevel, which
      also stores the hidden state.

      Using this interface it is possible to evaluate knowledge base
      computations and extract their results to concrete values. Since
      the knowledge base computations are not expression but objective
      language, i.e., they evaluate to knowledge base objects, not to
      values, we commonly need to create objects that will carry the
      result of the computation as their properties. To ease the
      process this module provides the notion of toplevel variables,
      that denote such properties. Here is an example, how to run a
      knowledge base computation and extract its result, assuming that
      [analysis] is a function of type [unit -> my knowledge]

      {[
        let result : my var = Toplevel.var "my-property"
        let run analysis : my =
          Toplevel.put result (analysis ());
          Toplevel.get result
      ]}

      There are also [eval] and [exec] functions that could be used to
      extract values from the existing properties, e.g.,

      {[
        let get_unit tid =
          eval Theory.Label.unit (KB.return tid)
      ]}

      Finally, the interface provides functions to control the inner
      state of the toplevel, which is the knowledge base that is used
      by BAP throught the lifetime of the BAP process and could be
      also persistet between runs. E.g., the [disassemble] plugin is
      persisting the knowledge base in the BAP cache facility and
      loads it when it identifies that the input digest is the same.

      Warning: this interface should be used with care, in particular,
      it shall not be used in the context of another knowledge
      computation that is also run in the toplevel.

      @since 2.2.0 made public and documented, the state interface
      was available since 2.0.0 but wasn't documented and considered
      official.

        The input code regions are speculatively disassembled and the

        described in {!Disasm.Driver}. After that the concrete whole
        program control-flow graph (CFG) is built, which can be
        accessed with the {!Project.disasm} function. The whole
        program CFG is then partitioned into a set of subroutines
        using the dominators analsysis, see {!Disasm.Subroutines} for
        details. Based on this partition a symbol table, which is a
        set of a subroutines control-flow graphs, is built. The symbol
        table, which can be accessed with {!Project.symbols}, also
        contains information about the interprocedural control
        flow. Finally, the symbol table is translated into the

        parameter defaults to [false] when [autorun] is [false], and
        to [true] otherwise.

        name of a pass, that should be run before the [pass]. The

        Reports that the task [t] made a progress to the stage [s] out
        the total number of stages [s']. The note [n] may provide an
        additional textual explanation of the current stage. The report
        doesn't mean that the stage is finished, but rather that it is
        entered. Thus for [s'] stages we expect to receive [s'-1]
        reports. (This approach works fine with functional programming
        and iterating - as in functional programming it is more
        convenient to report before computation, and during the indexed
        iteration the index of the last element is one less than the
        total number of elements).

        All parameters are optional, and have the following default
        values if not specified:

        @param task defaults to the plugin [name];
        @param note defaults to the empty string;
        @param stage defaults to [None]
        @param total defaults to [None] or to the last value of this
             parameter for the given task.

        The [report_progress] bar is an easy way to provide some
        feedback to the system, either in the form of a progress (if the
        total number of stages is known) or in the form of a friendly
        ping back.

        The mechanism should be used by analyses that expect to take
        some time to complete. Usually, one plugin implements only one
        task, so the task name may be omitted. If an analysis is built
        from several tasks, then they can be represented as subtasks,
        and the main task should represent the whole work.

        Example:
        {[

          let find_interesting_points prog =
            report_progress ~task:"discover" ~total:(Term.length sub_t prog) ();

          variable, and config file using the value of [name], with
          the type defined by [conv], using the [default] value if
          unspecified by user.

          The [default] is optional, and falls back to the
          default defined by [conv].

          [doc] is the man page information of the argument. The
          variable ["$(docv)"] can be used to refer to the value of
          [docv]. [docv] is a variable name used in the man page to
          stand for their value.

          A user can optionally add [deprecated] to a parameter that
          is to be deprecated soon. This will cause the parameter to be
          usable as normal, but will emit a warning to the user if they
          try to use it.
          Example usage: [Config.(param ~deprecated int "--old")].

          Additionally, [synonyms] can be added to allow multiple
          arguments referring to the same parameters. However, this is
          usually discouraged, and considered proper usage only in rare
          scenarios.

          Also, a developer can use the [~as_flag] to specify a
          default value that the argument takes if it is used like a
          flag. This behaviour can be understood better through the
          following example.

            Consider [Config.(param (some int) ~as_flag:(Some 10) "x")].

            This results in 3 possible command line invocations:

            1. No [--x] - Results in [default] value (specifically
                          here, [None]).

            2. Only [--x] - This causes it to have the value [as_flag]
                            (specifically here,[Some 10]).

            3. [--x=20] - This causes it to have the value from the
                          command line (specifically here, [Some 20]).

  (** {1 Binary Analysis Platform Library}  *)

  (** {2 Overview}

      BAP has a layered architecture consisting of four
      layers. Although the layers are not really observable from outside
      of the library, they make it easier to learn the library, as
      they introduce new concepts sequentially. On top of this layers,
      the {{!section:project}Project} module is defined, that
      consolidates all information about target of an
      analysis. [Project] module may be viewed as an entry point to
      the library.

      The {{!bfl}Foundation library} defines {{!Bil}BAP Instruction
      language} data types, as well as other useful data structures,
      like {!Value}, {!Trie}, {!Vector}, {!Graph}, etc. The
      {{!section:image}Memory model} layer is responsible for loading
      and parsing binary objects and representing them in computer
      memory. It also defines a few useful data structures that are
      used extensively by later layers, like {!Table} and
      {!Memmap}. The next layer performs
      {{!section:disasm}disassembly} and lifting to BIL. Finally, the
      {{!section:sema}semantic analysis} layer transforms a binary
      into an IR representation, that is suitable for writing analysis.

      Another important point of view is the BAP plugin architecture.
      Similar to GIMP or Frama-C, BAP features a pluggable architecture
      with a number of extension points. For example, even the LLVM
      disassembler is considered a type of plugin.  Currently we
      support three such extension points in BAP:

      - {{!Backend}loaders} - to add new binary object loaders;
      - disassemblers - to add new disassemblers;
      - {{!section:project}program analysis} - to write analysis.

      The latter category of plugins is most widely used. Therefore,
      when we use the term "plugin" without making a distinction, we
      refer to a program analysis plugin. The following figure
      provides an overview of the BAP system.

      v}

      All plugins have full access to the library; an important
      consequence is that they can and should open [Bap.Std]. The BAP
      library uses backend loader and disassembler plugins to provide
      its services. Program analysis plugins are loaded by BAP
      toolkit utilities. These utilities extend plugin functionality
      by providing access to the state of the target of analysis or,
      in our parlance, to the {{!project}project}. (See
      {!section:project}).

      Other than library itself, and the BAP toolkit, there are two
      additional libraries that are bundled with BAP:

      - [bap.plugins] to dynamically load code into BAP;
      - [bap.serialization] to serialize BAP data structures in
        different formats.
  *)


  (** {2:bfl Foundation Library}

      At this layer we define ({{!Bil}Binary Instruction language})
      and few other useful data structures:

      - {{!Arch}arch} - describes computer architecture;
      - {{!Size}size} - word and register sizes;
      - {{!Var}var}  - {{!Bil}BIL} variable;
      - {{!Type}typ} - {{!Bil}BIL} type system;
      - {{!Exp}exp}  - {{!Bil}BIL} expression sub-language;
      - {{!Stmt}stmt} - {{!Bil}BIL} statements;
      - {{!Bitvector}bitvector} - a bitvector data structure
        to represent immediate data, used usually by their aliases
      - {!word} and {!addr};
      - {{!Value}value} - an extensible variant type;
      - {{!Dict}dict} - an extensible record;
      - {{!Vector}vector} - array that can grow;
      - {{!Seq}'a seq} - slightly extended Core [Sequence], aka lazy
        list;
      - {{!Trie}Trie} - prefix trees;
      - {{!Graph}Graph} - graph implementations and library.


      Most of the types implement the {{!Regular}Regular}
      interface. This interface is very similar to Core's
      [Identifiable], and is supposed to represent a type that is as
      common as a built-in type. One should expect to find any
      function that is implemented for such types as [int], [string],
      [char], etc.  Namely, this interface includes:

      - comparison functions: ([<, >, <= , >= , compare, between, ...]);
      - each type defines a polymorphic [Map] with keys of type [t];
      - each type provides a [Set] with values of type [t];
      - hashtable is exposed via [Table] module;
      - hashset is available under [Hash_set] name
      - sexpable and binable interface;
      - [to_string], [str], [pp], [ppo], [pps] functions
      for pretty-printing.

      Most types usually provide much more. For each type, there is a
      module with the same name that implements its interface. For
      example, type [exp] is indeed a type abbreviation for [Exp.t],
      and module [Exp] contains all functions and types related to
      type [exp]. For example, to create a hashtable of statements,
      just type:

      [let table = Stmt.Table.create ()]

      If a type is a variant type (i.e., defines constructors) then for
      each constructor named [Name], there exists a corresponding
      function named [name] that will accept the same number of
      arguments as the arity of the constructor. For example, a
      [Bil.Int] can be constructed with the [Bil.int] function that
      has type [word -> exp]. If a constructor has several arguments
      of the same type we usually disambiguate them with keywords,
      e.g., [Bil.Load of (exp,exp,endian,size)] has function
      {{!Bil.load}Bil.load} with type:
      [mem:exp -> addr:exp -> endian -> size -> exp]

      {3:value Value}

      {{!Value}Universal values} can be viewed as extensible variants on
      steroids. Not only they maybe extended, but they also can be
      serialized, compared with user-defined comparison function and
      even pretty printed.


      {3:dict Dict}

      Like {{!Value}value} is an extensible sum type, {{!Dict}dict}
      can be viewed as extensible product type. Dict is a sequence of
      values of type {!value}, with {{!Value.Tag}tags} used as field
      names. Of course, fields are unique.

      {3:vector Vector}

      Vector is an implementation of C++ STL like vectors with
      logarithmic push back.

      {3:tries Tries}

      The Foundation library also defines a prefix tree data structure
      that proves to be useful for binary analysis applications.
      {{!module:Trie}Trie}s in BAP is a functor that derives a
      polymorphic trie data structure for a given
      {{!modtype:Trie.Key}Key}.

      For convenience we support instantiating tries for most of
      our data structures. For example, {{!Bitvector}Word} has several
      {{!Bitvector.Trie}tries} inside.

      For common strings, there's {!Trie.String}.


  *)

  (** {2:image Memory model}

      This layer provides everything you need to work with binary
      objects:

      - {{!Memory}mem} - a contiguous array of bytes, indexed with
       absolute addresses;

      - {{!Table} 'a table} - a mapping from a memory regions to
       arbitrary data (no duplicates or intersections);

      - {{!Memmap}a memmap} - a mapping from memory region to
        arbitrary data with duplicates and intersections allowed, aka
        segment tree or interval map;

      - {{!Image}image} - represents a binary object with all its
       symbols, segments, sections and other meta information.

      The [Image] module uses the plugin system to load binary
      objects. In order to add new loader, one should implement the
      {{!Backend}Backend.t} loader function and register it with the
      {{!Image.register_backend}Image.register_backend} function. *)


  (** {2:disasm Disassembler}

      This layer consists of disassemblers and lifters. They are
      tightly integrated, but in general we can disassemble all
      supported {{!Arch.t}architectures}. Currently we lift only arm,
      x86 and x86_64.


      There are two interfaces to disassemblers:

      - {{!Disasm}Disasm} - a regular interface that hides all
       complexities, but may not always be very flexible.
      - {{!Disasm_expert}Disasm_expert} - an expert interface that
      provides access to a low-level representation. It is very
      flexible and fast, but harder to use.

      To disassemble files or data with the regular interface, use
      one of the following functions:

      - {{!disassemble}disassemble} - to disassemble a region of
        memory;
      - {{!disassemble_image}disassemble_image} - to disassemble a
        loaded binary object;
      - {{!disassemble_file}disassemble_file} or
        {{!disassemble_file_exn}disassemble_file} - to disassemble
        file.

      All these functions perform disassembly by recursive descent,
      reconstruct the control flow graph, and perform lifting. The
      result of disassembly is represented by the abstract value of
      type {{!Disasm}disasm}. Two main data structures that are used
      to represent disassembled program are:

      - {{!Insn}insn} - a machine instruction;
      - {{!Block}block} - a basic block, i.e., a linear sequence of
        instructions.

      The following figure shows the relationship between basic data
      structures of the disassembled program.

        | |     stmt    | |
        | +-------------+ |
        +-----------------+
      v}


      A disassembled program is represented as a set of
      interconnected {{!Block}basic blocks}. You can navigate between
      blocks using {{!Block_traverse.succs}Block.succs} and
      {{!Block_traverse.preds}Block.preds} functions, or you can
      transform a set of blocks into a real {{!Block.Cfg}graph} using
      the {{!Block.to_graph}Block.to_graph} function. Sometimes it
      is enough to traverse program using
      {{!Block.dfs}depth-first search}.

      Each block is a container to a sequence of machine
      instructions. It is guaranteed that there's at least one
      instruction in the block, thus the
      {{!Block_accessors.leader}Block.leader} and
      {{!Block_accessors.terminator}Block.terminator} functions are
      total.

      Each {{!Insn}machine instruction} is represented by its
      [opcode], [name] and [array] of operands (these are machine and
      disassembler specific), a set of predicates (describing
      instruction semantics on a very high level), and a sequence of
      {{!Bil}BIL} statements that precisely define the semantics of
      the instruction.

      Modules of type {{!CPU}CPU} provide a high level abstraction of
      the CPU and allow one to reason about instruction semantics
      independently from the target platform. The module type
      {{!Target}Target} brings [CPU] and [ABI] together. To get an
      instance of this module, you can use the
      {{!target_of_arch}target_of_arch} function. For accessing all
      information about target platform, use the following modules
      that expose low-level and platform-specific details:

      - {{!ARM}ARM}
      - {{!IA32}IA32}
      - {{!AMD64}AMD64}


      If you do not need cfg reconstruction, you can use
      {{!linear_sweep}linear_sweep} function to disassemble a given
      memory region. If you need more granularity, then you can use
      the expert interface accordingly:

      - {{!Disasm_expert.Basic}Basic} - provides access to a low-level
        disassembler on top of which all other disassemblers are
        built;
      - {{!Disasm_expert.Recursive}Recursive} - an interface to a
        recursive descent algorithm.

  (** {2:sema Semantic Analysis}

      On semantic level the disassembled program is lifted into the
      intermediate representation (IR) suitable for writing analysis.

      IR is closely related to BIL. In fact it even reuses expression
      sub-language of BIL. But unlike BIL, IR is flat, (i.e., it
      doesn't contain recursive statements), and unstructured (no
      [while], [if], only jumps). Thus IR is much more low-level, so
      it is harder to read, but easier to analyze programmatically.

      The program in IR is build of terms. In fact the program itself
      is also a term. There're only 7 kinds of terms:

      - {{!Program}program} - the program in whole;
      - {{!Sub}sub} - subroutine;
      - {{!Arg}arg} - subroutine argument;
      - {{!Blk}blk} - basic block;
      - {{!Def}def} - definition of a variable;
      - {{!Phi}phi} - phi-node in the SSA form;
      - {{!Jmp}jmp} - a transfer of control.

      Unlike expressions and statements in BIL, IR's terms are
      {e concrete entities}.  Concrete entity is such entity that can
      change in time and space, as well as come in and out of
      existence.  Contrary, {e abstract entity} is eternal and
      unchangeable.  {e Identity} denotes the sameness of a concrete
      entity as it changes in time.  Abstract entities don't have an
      identity since they are immutable.  Program is built of concrete
      entities called terms.  Terms have {e attributes} that can change in
      time, without affecting the identity of a term.  Attributes are
      abstract entities.  In each particular point of space and time a
      term is represented by a snapshot of all its attributes,
      colloquially called {e value}.  Functions that change the value of a
      term in fact returns a new value with different set of
      attributes.  For example, [def] term has two attributes: left
      hand side (lhs), that associates definition with abstract
      variable, and right hand side (rhs) that associates [def] with
      an abstract expression. Suppose, that the definition was:

      {[
        # let d_1 = Def.create x Bil.(var y + var z);;
        val d_1 : Def.t = 00000001: x := y + z
      ]}

      To change the right hand side of a definition we use
      [Def.with_rhs] that returns the {e same} definition but with
      {e different} value:

      {[
        # let d_2 = Def.with_rhs d_1 Bil.(int Word.b1);;
        val d_2 : Def.t = 00000001: x := true
      ]}

      [d_1] and [d_2] is different values

      {[
        # Def.equal d_1 d_2;;
        - : bool = false
      ]}  of the same term {[
        # Term.same d_1 d_2;;
        - : bool = true
      ]}

      The identity of this terms is denoted by the term identifier
      ([tid]). In the textual representation term identifiers are
      printed as ordinal numbers.

      Terms, can contain other terms. But unlike BIL expressions or
      statements, this relation is not truly recursive, since the
      structure of program term is fixed: [arg], [phi], [def], [jmp]
      are leaf terms; [sub] can only contain [arg]'s or [blk]'s; [blk]
      consists of [phi], [def] and [jmp] sequences of terms, as
      pictured in the figure below.  Although, the term structure is
      closed to changes, you still can extend particular term with
      attributes, using [set_attr] and [get_attr] functions of the
      {{!Term}Term} module. This functions are using {{!Value}extensible
      variant} type to encode attributes.

  (** {2:project Working with project}

      There're two general approaches to obtain a value of type
      {{!Project}project}:
      - create it manually using one of the [Project.from_*] function;
      - to write a plugin to a [bap] utility

      Although the first approach is simplistic and gives you a full
      control, we still recommend to use the latter, as [bap] utility
      will provide you integration with different tools, like IDA, as
      well as interaction with a user and other plugins.

      To write a program analysis plugin (or pass in short) you need to
      implement a function with one of the following interfaces:

      - [project -> project] and register it with
        {{!Project.register_pass}register_pass};
      - [project -> unit] and register it with
         {{!Project.register_pass'}register_pass'};
      - [string array -> project -> project] and register it with
        {{!Project.register_pass_with_args}register_pass_with_args};
      - [string array -> project -> unit] and register it with
        {{!Project.register_pass_with_args'}register_pass_with_args'}.

      Once loaded from the [bap] utility (see [man bap]) this function
      will be invoked with a value of type {{!Project.t}project} that
      provides access to all information gathered over the binary so
      far. If the registered function returns a non [unit] type, then it
      can functionally update the project state, e.g., add
      annotations, discover new symbols, make corrections, and even
      change the architecture and re-disassemble everything.

      {3 Example}

      The following plugin prints all sections in a file:

      {[
        open Core_kernel.Std
        open Bap.Std
        open Format

        let print_sections p =
          Project.memory p |> Memmap.to_sequence |> Seq.iter ~f:(fun (mem,x) ->
              Option.iter (Value.get Image.section x) ~f:(fun name ->
                  printf "Section: %s@.%a@." name Memory.pp mem))

        let () = Project.register_pass' "print-sections" print_sections
      ]}

      {3 Exchanging information}

      For exchanging information in a type safe manner, we use
      {{!Value}universal values}. Values can be attached to a
      particular memory region, IR terms, or put into the [storage]
      dictionary. For the first case we use the {{!Memmap}memmap} data
      structure.  It is an interval tree containing all the memory
      regions that are used during analysis. For the [storage] we use
      [Dict] data structure.

      {3 Memory marks}

      By default the memory is marked with the following marks:

      - {{!Image.section}section} -- for regions of memory that had a
      particular name in the original binary. For example, in ELF,
      sections have names that annotate a corresponding memory
      region. If project was created from memory object, then the
      overall memory will be marked as a ["bap.user"] section.

      - {{!Image.segment}segment} -- if the binary data was loaded
      from a binary format that contains segments, then the
      corresponding memory regions are be marked. Segments provide
      access to permission information.  *)

  (** Monad is an interface, that is pervasives through many data
      types. Such types are called monadic. Monad interface is
      practical for both data (list, option, etc), and codata (Future,
      Lwt, Deferred, Lazy, Continuation). The interpretation of each
      monad interface is different for each data type. But in general
      monad interface consists of two functions:
        - [return : 'a -> 'a t]
        - [bind : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b t) -> 'b t].

      This is a minimal definition. Many functions can be inferred
      based on this interface, see [Monad.S] for the full list.


      [Option] monad, as well as [Or_error] and [Result] monads, is suitable
      for building control flow. They can be seen as a reification of
      exception. A chain of such monads link with the [bind] function,
      will break as soon as monadic zero value occurs.

      [Future], as well as [Lwt] or [Async], provides a safe access to
      codata, i.e., to a value that is defined somewhere outside of
      the main program, or to a value that is represented by an
      effectful computation, not by inductive data. [Lwt] and [Async]
      are also so called [IO] monads, that reifies side-effects,
      mostly [IO]. [State] monad is another example of reification of
      computation effect. The [State] monad is useful to build purely
      functional computation with side-effects. The side-effect, e.g.,
      writing to a memory cell, is reified into an OCaml value, and
      practically becomes a first class value, i.e., it can be stored,
      printed, etc.

    (** State monad interface.

        State monad is an interface to a computation that has a
        limited side effect. The side effect is defined by the
        following two functions:
        - [put s]  -- that will store value [s]
        - [get ()] -- that will extract the value.


        There're few functions derived on [get] and [put], like
        [gets], [update], [modify], but the minimal algebra is
        [put] and [set].


        The value of type [('a,'s) t] bears a computation that
        has an access to the state of type ['s], and evaluates
        to a value of type ['a]. It can be said, that ['s] reifies
        effect of computation of value ['a].

          overriding the existent one with the new one. An imperative
          counterpart of this operation is a statement that performs
          side effect, e.g., {[put x]} is somewhat equivalent to

    (** Monad transformers.

        [module IO = Monad.T.Inner(Outer)] is a monad
        [Inner] wrapped into monad [Outer]. For example, monad
        [module OLwt = Monad.T.Option(Lwt)] will
        allow to work with optional values in the [Lwt] IO monad,
        e.g.,

        {[
          open OLwt
          let require p = if p then return (Some ()) else return None
          let authenticate user passwd =
            read_credentials >>= fun (u,p) ->
            require (user = u) >>= fun () ->
            require (passwd = p)
        ]}


        Not all monands are transformable into anothers. For example,
        in general it is not possible to wrap IO monad into other monad
        (but it is possible to in the opposite direction). State monad
        here is a special case, although it is very similiar to the IO
        monad it still can be wrapped into some other monad. However,
        this wrapping is more like intersection, as the returned monad
        actually behaves like an intersection of the outer and inner
        monad.

          [module STM = Monad.T.State.Make(M)] is not a monad [M], but a
          state monad which build computations that are interleaved
          with computations of monad [M]. For example, let's take
          the [Future] as the outer monad:

          [module STF = Monad.T.State.Make(Future)] will build a
          computation that can access values that are defined in the
          future, as a consequence, [STF.run] result will be a value that
          would be defined in the future. The computation built with
          [STF] monad will not try to access any future values until [run] is
          called. Once it is called, each step of the computation will
          first wait until the future occurs (i.e., future value is
          defined) and then perform update of the state.

          As an another example, given some [IO] monad, a computation

  (** Bitvector -- a type for representing binary values.

      {2 Overview }

      A numeric value with a 2-complement binary representation. It is
      good for representing addresses, offsets and other numeric values.

      Each value is attributed by a its bit-width. All arithmetic
      operations over values are done modulo their widths. It is an
      error to apply arithmetic operation to values with different
      widths. Default implementations will raise a [Width] exception,
      however there exists a family of modules that provide arithmetic
      operations lifted to an [Or_error.t] monad. It is suggested to use
      them, if you know what kind of operands you're expecting.


      {2 Clarifications endianness and bit-ordering }

      Bitvector should be considered as an number with an arbitrary
      width. That means, that as with all numbers it is subject to
      endianness. When we iterate over bitvector using some container
      interface we always start from the byte with the lower
      address. Depending on endianness it will be either least
      significant bytes (little-endian), or most significant
      (big-endian). Sometimes id does matter, sometimes it doesn't. In a
      latter case you can just use a default native-endian
      interface. But in a former case, please consider using explicit
      modules, either [Bytes_LE] or [Bytes_BE], even if you know that
      your system is [LE]. Things change.

      Bits are always numbered from right to left, with least
      significant bit having a zero index, and most significant having
      index equal to [width - 1]. That means, they're endianness
      agnostic.

      {2 Clarification on size-morphism }

      Size-monomorphic operations (as opposed to size-polymorphic
      comparison) doesn't allow to compare two operands with different
      sizes, and either raise exception or return [Error]. If we would
      have type safe interface, with type [t] defined as [type 'a t],
      where ['a] stands for size, then size-monomorphic operations will
      have type ['a t -> 'a t -> _], and size-polymorphic ['a t -> 'b t -> _].

      By default, size-polymorphic comparison is used (for rationale of
      this decision look at the implementation of a hash function). To
      understand the ordering relation one can think that a lexical
      ordering is specified on a tuple [(x,n)], where [x] is the number
      and [n] is the size. For example, the following sequence is in an
      ascending order:

      {[ 0x0:1, 0x0:32, 0x0:64, 0x1:1, 0x1:32, 0xD:4, 0xDEADBEEF:32]}.

      A size-monomorphic interfaced is exposed in a [Mono] submodule. So
      if you want a monomorphic map, then just use [Mono.Map] module.
      Note, [Mono] submodule doesn't provide [Table], since we cannot
      guarantee that all keys in a hash-table have equal size.

      {2 Clarification on signs}

      By default all numbers represented by a bitvector are considered
      unsigned. This includes comparisons, e.g., [of_int (-1) ~width:32]
      is greater than zero. If you need to perform signed operation, you
      can use [signed] operator to temporary cast your value to signed.
      We use temporary to emphasize that, the signedness property won't
      propagate to the result of the operation, e.g. result of the
      following expression: [Int_exn.(signed x / y)] will not be signed.

      If any operand of a binary operation is signed, then a signed
      version of an operation is used.

      Remember to use explicit casts, whenever you really need a signed
      representation. Examples:
      {[
        let x = of_int ~-6 ~width:8
        let y = to_int x          (* y = 250 *)
        let z = to_int (signed x) (* z = ~-6 *)
        let zero = of_int 0 ~width:8
        let p = x < zero          (* p = false *)
        let q = signed x < zero   (* p = true *)
      ]}

      {2 Clarification on string representation }

      As a part of [Identifiable] interface bitvector provides a pair of
      complement functions: [to_string] and [of_string], that provides
      facilities to store bitvector as a human readable string, and to
      restore it from string. The format of the representation is the
      following (in EBNF):
      {[
        repr  = [sign], base, digit, {digit}, ":", size | true | false;
        sign  = "+" | "-";
        base  = "0x" | "0b" | "0o";
        size  = dec, {dec};
        digit = dec | oct | hex;
        dec   = ?decimal digit?;
        oct   = ?octal digit?;
        hex   = ?hexadecimal digit?;
      ]}

      Examples:
      [0x5D:32, 0b0101:16, 5:64, +5:8, +0x5D:16, true, false.].

      Form [false] is a shortcut for [0:1], as well as [true] is [1:1].

      If [base] is omitted base-10 is assumed. The output format is
      lways ["0x", hex, {hex}] in an unsigned form. *)

      BIL variables are regular values. Variables can have

      variable but at different time or space (control flow path).
      This is particulary useful for representing variables in SSA
      form.

      By default, comparison functions takes indices into account. In
      order to compare two variables regardless their index use [same]
      function, or compare with [base x].

      A variable can represent a physical register or be just a virtual
      variable.

    (** Value of a result.
        We slightly diverge from an operational semantics by allowing
        a user to provide its own storage implementation.

        In operational semantics a storage is represented
        syntactically as
        {v
            v1 with [v2,ed] : nat <- v3,
        v}
        where v1 may be either a [Bot] value, representing an empty
        memory (or an absence of knowledge), or another storage. So a
        well typed memory object is defined inductively as:

        {v
          Inductive memory :=
           | bot : memory
           | store : (mem : memory) (addr : value) (data : value).
        v}

        That is equivalent to an assoc list. Although we provide an
        assoc list as storage variant (see {!Storage.linear}), the
        default storage is implemented slightly more effective, and
        uses linear space and provides $log(N)$ lookup and update
        methods. Users are encouraged to provide more efficient
        storage implementations, for interpreters that rely heave on
        memory throughput.

        Result of an expression evaluation depends on a context.
        Thus, each result has a unique identifier, associated with it,

        evaluated under a given context. Since, context is changed
        during the evaluation (at least because a new result is
        allocated), two consecutive evaluations of the same expression
        will give different results. (This property is preserved by
        Expi.context class, that provides methods for creating values
        of type result).

        Since [Result.Id] is a regular type, it is possible to

        literally. This means that comparison is sensitive to variable
        names and immediate values. Depending on your context it may be
        find or not. For example, two [SP] variables may compare as different
        if one of them was obtained from different compilation (and met
        the other one through some persistant storage, e.g., file on hard
        disk). Moreover, BIL obtained from different lifters will have
        different names for the same registers. All this issues are
        addressed in normalized [Trie]. *)

          1. All immediate values are compared equal
          2. All variables are compared nominally
          3. BIL is simplified to reduce the syntactic differences
          (but the comparison is still syntactic, and (x + 2) will
          be compared differently to (2 + x).

       evaluation of expressions.

    end

    (** Expression interpreter.

        Expi is a base class for all other interpreters (see {!bili}
        and {!biri}, that do all the hard work. Expi recognizes a
        language defined by [exp] type. It evaluates arbitrary
        expressions under provided {{!Context}context}.


        To create new interpreter use operator [new]:

        {v
        let expi = new expi;;
        val expi : _#Expi.context expi = <obj>
        v}

        Note: The type [_#Expi.context] is weakly polymorphic subtype of
        [Expi.context][1]. Basically, this means, that the type is not
        generalized and will be instantiated when used and fixed
        afterwards.

        {v
        let r = expi#eval_exp Bil.(int Word.b0 lor int Word.b1);;
        val r : _#Expi.context Bil.Result.r = <abstr>
        v}

        The returned value is a state monad parametrized by a subtype
        of class [Expi.context]. The state monad is a chain of
        computations, where each computation is merely a function from
        state to a state paired with the result of computation. The
        state is accessible inside the computation and can be
        changed.

        To run the computation use [Monad.State.eval] function, that
        accepts a state monad and an initial value. Here we can
        provide any subtype of [Expi.context] as an initial
        value. Let start with a [Expi.context] as first approximation:

        {v
        let x = Monad.State.eval r (new Expi.context);;
        val x : Bil.result = [0x3] true
        v}

        The expression evaluates to [true], and the result is tagged
        with an identifier [[0x3]]. The [Exp.context] assigns a unique
        identifier for each freshly created result. Tag [[0x3]] means
        that this was the third value created under provided context.

        If the only thing, that you need is just to evaluate an
        expression, then you can just use [Exp.eval] function:

        {v
        Exp.eval Bil.(int Word.b0 lor int Word.b1);;
        - : Bil.value = true
        v}

        The main strength of [expi] is its extensibility. Let's write
        a expression evaluator that will record a trace of evaluation:

        {[
          class context = object
            inherit Expi.context
            val events : (exp * Bil.result) list = []
            method add_event exp res = {< events = (exp,res) :: events >}
            method events = List.rev events
          end
        ]}

        {[
          class ['a] exp_tracer = object
            constraint 'a = #context
            inherit ['a] expi as super
            method! eval_exp e =
              let open Monad.State in
              super#eval_exp e >>= fun r ->
              get () >>= fun ctxt ->
              put (ctxt#add_event e r) >>= fun () ->
              return r
          end;;
        ]}

        Note : We made our [exp_tracer] class polymorphic as a
        courtesy to our fellow programmer, that may want to reuse it.
        We can define it by inheriting from [expi] parametrized with
        our context type, like this: [inherit [context] expi]

        Also, there is no need to write a [constraint], as it will be
        inferred automatically.

        Now, let's try to use our tracer. We will use
        [Monad.State.run] function, that returns both, the evaluated
        value and the context. (We can also use [Monad.State.exec], if
        we're not interested in value at all):

        {v
        let expi = new exp_tracer;;
        val expi : _#context exp_tracer = <obj>
        # let r = expi#eval_exp Bil.(int Word.b0 lor int Word.b1);;
        val r : _#context Bil.Result.r = <abstr>
        # let r,ctxt = Monad.State.run r (new context) ;;
        val r : Bil.result = [0x3] true
        val ctxt : context = <obj>
        ctxt#events;;
        - : (exp * Bil.result) list =
        [(false, [0x1] false); (true, [0x2] true); (false | true, [0x3] true)]
        v}

        [1]: The weakness of the type variable is introduced by
        a value restriction and can't be relaxed since it is invariant
        in state monad.

    (** Visitor.
        Visits AST providing lots of hooks.

        For each AST constructor [C] the visitor provides three methods:
        [enter_C], [visit_C], [leave_C]. The default implementation for
        [enter_C] and [leave_C] is to return its argument. The default
        implementation for [visit_C] is the following:
        1. call [enter_C]
        2. visit all children
        3. call [leave_C].

        It is recommended to override [enter_C] method if you only need
        to visit [C] constructor without changing a way you're visiting
        the tree.

        For example, to collect all resolved jumps one could write the
        following function:

        {[
          let collect_calls bil = (object(self)
            inherit [Word.t list] visitor
            method! enter_int x js = if in_jmp then x :: js else js
          end)#run bil []
        ]}

         The default entry point of the visitor is method [run], but
         you can use any other method as well, for example, if you do
         not have a statement at all and want to visit expression.
    *)
    class ['a] visitor : object

    end


    (** A visitor with shortcut.
        Finder is a specialization of a visitor, that uses [return] as its
        folding argument. At any time you can stop the traversing by
        calling [return] function of the provided argument (which is by
        itself is a record with one field - a function accepting argument
        of type ['a option]).

        For example, the following function will check whether [x]
        variable is assigned (i.e., occurs on the left of the
        assignment operator) in the provided scope.
        {[
          let is_assigned x = find (object(self)
              inherit [unit] finder
              method! enter_move y _rhs cc =
                if Var.(x = y) then cc.return (Some ()); cc
            end)
        ]}

        There're three [find] functions in the library, that accepts
        an object of type [finder]:

        - [Bil.finder] searches in the [stmt list] aka [bil]
        - [Stmt.finder] searches in [stmt]
        - [Exp.finder] searches in [exp].

        In addition, you can use this object directly, using one of
        the two provided entry points.  *)
    class ['a] finder : object
      inherit ['a option return] visitor
      method find : t list -> 'a option
    end


    (** AST transformation.
        mapper allows one to map AST, performing some limited
        amount of transformations on it. Mapper provides extra
        flexibility by mapping [stmt] to [stmt list], thus allowing
        to remove statements from the output (by mapping to empty list) or
        to map one statement to several. This is particularly useful when
        you map [if] or [while] statements. *)
    class mapper : object
      inherit Exp.mapper

  (** Universal Values.

      This module creates an extensible variant type, that resembles
      extensible variant types, introduced in 4.02, but even more safe
      and more extensible, and, what really matters,
      serializable. Basically you should think of [Value.t] as a union
      type, aka sum type, that can be extended in any place, including
      your plugin code. Where extending is adding new constructor. To
      add new constructor, you need to register it, e.g.,

      {[
        let function_signature = Value.Tag.register (module String)
            ~name:"function_signature"
            ~uuid:"2175c28c-08ca-4052-8385-3a01e1c6ab6f"
      ]}

      This is merely equivalent to adding a branch

      {[
        | Function_signature of string
      ]}

      to existing union type. The main difference is that the [name]
      shouldn't be unique (in fact [name] doesn't bear any semantic
      meaning, it basically for pretty-printing). On the other hand
      the [uuid] parameter must be unique across the universe, space
      and time. To get the UUID with such properties, you can use
      [uuidgen] program that is usually available on Linux and Mac OS.

      [name] and [uuid] must be strings, known at compile time, in
      other words it must be string literal, not just an arbitrary
      string, created dynamically. This is made intentionally, in
      order to prevent the abuse of the system.

      The [(module String)] syntax creates a value from the module
      [String], (so called first-class module). The module should
      implement [Value.S] signature, that requires pretty-printing,
      comparison function and serialization.

      {[
        module type S = sig
          type t with bin_io, compare, sexp

          val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
        end
      ]}


      The good news is that, most of the types in [Core] and [Bap] do
      conform with the requirements. Usually, one can implement the
      requirements very easily by using type-driven syntax extensions
      (although, you still need to implement pretty-printing function
      yourself):

      {[
        module Loc = struct
          type t = string * int * int
          with bin_io, compare, sexp

          let pp ppf (file,line,col) =
            Format.fprintf ppf "%s:%d:%d" file line col
        end

        let loc = Value.Tag.register (module Loc)
            ~name:"loc"
            ~uuid:"400e190e-ce21-488d-87b1-c101709621a8"
      ]}

      The returned value, is a tag that can be used to constructed
      values of that branch, and to deconstruct (extract) them. You
      may think of it as a cipher key, that is used to package data
      into the value container, and later to unpack it:

      {[
        # let main_pos = Value.create loc ("test.c", 20, 2);;
        val main_pos : value = test.c:20:2
      ]}

      You may see, that OCaml pretty-prints the value. That's neat!
      Also, you may see, that the returned expression has type
      [value]. That means that it can be used uniformly with other
      values, for example, you can put them in one container, e.g.,

      {[
        # let main_t = Value.create function_signature
              "void main(int argc, const char *argv[])";;
        val main_t : value = void main(int argc, const char *argv[])
      ]}

      {[
        # let main = [main_pos; main_t];;
        val main : value list = [
            test.c:20:2;
            void main(int argc, const char *argv[])
          ]
      ]}

      To extract value you can use [Value.get] function:

      {[
        # Value.get loc main_pos;;
        - : Loc.t option = Some ("test.c", 20, 2)
      ]}

      This will require an extra allocation of an [option] container,
      and in a performance critical context it may be unacceptable.
      For this special case you can use a more efficient:

      {[if Value.is loc then Value.get_exn loc main_pos]}.

      Underneath the hood, the values of type [value] is just a pair
      of an original value and runtime type information. For
      performance reasons the RTTI is usually just an integer. But
      for serialization we use persistent UUID for storing RTTI type.
      To get it, one can use [Value.typeid] function.

      The comparison of two values of type [value] is actually a
      multi-method, as it has the following behavior:

      1. If both values has the same type, then use [compare]
         function, that was provided for this type.
      2. If values are of different types, that are known to
         the type system, then compare them using RTTI
      3. If at least one of the values is of the unknown type,
         (i.e., type wasn't registered in the type system), then
         use polymorphic compare on a tuple of UUID and binary
         representation of the values.

      This algorithm implies that ordering may change a little bit
      between different compiler versions and different programs, as
      RTTI is generated from scratch at every program start. If it
      really matters (usually it doesn't), then you should use
      [typeid] as key. In that case the ordering would be stable
      across space time. In any case it is not recommended to use data
      structures where [value]s are used as keys. For this case, we
      provide {{!Dict}Dict} data structure, that is a heterogeneous
      dictionary of values.

      {2 Thread safety}

      The only thread unsafe function is [register], that should be
      called in the module initialization time. In general programs
      modules are initialized in a single thread, so this shouldn't be
      an issue.  The implementation by itself doesn't call [register].

    (** [link relation t t1 t2] takes two tables and returns a mapping
        from elements of one table to elements of other table.

        Parameter [t] specifies a [hashable] typeclass of the type ['a]. If
        type ['a] implements [Hashable] interface, then you can obtain it
        with [hashable] function, e.g. [Int.hashable] with return the
        appropriate type class. If ['a] doesn't implement [Hashable], then
        it can be implemented manually.

        Relation specifies the multiplicity of the relation between
        entities from table [t1] to entities from table [t2], and is
        summarized below:

        - [one_to_many] means that a particular region from table [t1] can
        span several memory regions from table [t2]. Example: segments
        to symbols relation.

        - [one_to_one] means that for each value of type ['a] there is
        exactly one value of type ['b]. This relation should be used with
        caution, since it is quantified over _all_ values of type
        ['a]. Indeed, it should be used only for cases, when it can be
        guaranteed, that it is impossible to create such value of type
        ['b], that has no correspondence in table [t2]. Otherwise,
        [one_to_maybe_one] relation should be used. Example: llvm
        machine code to assembly string relation.

        - [one_to_maybe_one] means that for each value in table [t1] there
        exists at most one value in table [t2]. Example: function to
        symbol relation.

    (** [rev_map arity t tab] creates a reverse mapping from values of
        typeclass [t] stored in table [tab] to memory regions.

        Note. not every mapping is reversable, for example, trying to obtain
        a reverse of surjective mapping as a one-to-one mapping will
        result in an error. But surjective mappings can be reversed
        using [~one_to:many] mapping. A particular example of surjective
        mapping is [symbol] tables, in a case when functions can occupy
        several non-contiguous regions of memory.

        For example, to create a mapping from a function symbol to
        sequence of memory regions with it code:

        {[rev_map one_to:many Sym.hashable tab]}

    *)

    (** {2 Iterators}

        This section provides a common set of iterators. Note: name
        iterator is used in a functional meaning, i.e., an iterator is a
        function that takes a data structure and another function, and
        applies it to all elements in some manner.

        All iterators share some common part of interface that was lifted
        to a ['a ranged] type. When you see

        [('a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool) ranged]

        just mentally substitute it with:

        [?start -> ?until -> 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool].

        In other words ['f ranged] just prepends [?start -> ?until ->] to
        function with type ['f] (do not forget that ['f] can be an arrow
        type).

        [start] and [until] parameters allows to narrow iteration to some
        subset of table. If they are unspecified then iteration would be
        performed on all table entries in an ascending order of
        addresses. If they are specified, then if [start <= until], then
        iteration will be performed in the same order but on a specified
        subset. In the case, when [start > until], iteration will be
        performed in a decreasing order.

      (** [run ?stop_on ?invalid ?stopped dis mem ~init ~return ~hit]
          performs recursive disassembly of specified memory [mem]. The
          process of disassembly can be driven using [stop], [step], [back]
          and [jump] functions, described later.

          @param backlog defines a size of history of states, that can
          be used for backtracking. Defaults to some positive natural
          number.

          @param stop_on defines a set of predicates that will be checked
          on each step to decide whether it should stop here and call a
          user-provided [hit] function, or it should continue. The descision
          is made acording to the rule: [if exists stop_on then stop], i.e.,
          it there exists such predicate in a set of predicates, that
          evaluates to true, then stop the disassembly and pass the control
          to the user function [hit].  A few notes: only valid instructions
          can match predicates, and if the set is empty, then it always
          evaluates to false.

          @param init initial value of user data, that can be passed
          through handlers (cf., [fold])

          @param return a function that lifts user data type ['s] to type
          ['r]. It is useful when you need to perform disassembly in some
          monad, like [Or_error], or [Lwt]. Otherwise, just use [ident]
          function and assume that ['s == 'r].

          In a process of disassembly user provided callbacks are invoked by
          the engine. To each callback at least two parameters are passed:
          [state] and [user_data]. [user_data] is arbitrary data of type ['s]
          with which the folding over the memory is actually
          performed. [state] incapsulates the current state of the
          disassembler, and provides continuation functions, namely [stop],
          [next] and [back], that drives the process of disassembly. This
          functions are used to pass control back to the disassembler.

          [stopped state user_data] is called when there is no more data to
          disassemble. This handler is optional and defaults to [stop].

          [invalid state user_data] is an optional handler that is called on
          each invalid instruction (i.e., a portion of data that is not a
          valid instruction), it defaults to [step], i.e., to skipping.

          [hit state mem insn data] is called when one of the predicates
          specifed by a user was hit. [insn] is actually the instruction
          that satisfies the predicate. [mem] is a memory region spanned by
          the instruction. [data] is a user data. [insn] can be queried for
          assembly string and kinds even if the corresponding modes are
          disabled.  *)

        This module implements a graph view on an intermediate
        representation of a subroutine. To create an instance of a
        graph, using existing subroutine use {!Sub.to_cfg}. At any
        moment current sub term can be obtained using {!Sub.of_cfg}
        function. This is a just a projection operation, so it doesn't
        take any computing time.

        All [Graph] modification operations, like [insert], [remove]
        and [update] in [Node] and [Edge] modules are mapped to
        corresponding [Term] operations. Also, for performance
        reasons, graph is augmented with auxiliary data structures,
        that allows to perform most of the operations in O(log(N))
        time.

        Although this implements all operations of {!Graph} interface
        it is recommended to use {!Term} or [Builder] interfaces to
        build and modify underlying terms. The next few sections will
        clarify the behavior of a graph when it is modified using
        {!Graph} interface. If you do not want to read the following
        sections, then better do not use this module to build your
        terms.

        {2 Inserting nodes}

        When node is inserted into a graph [g] all jumps of a node,
        that lead to blocks that are already in a graph will be
        represented as edges. Also, all jumps from other nodes to the
        inserted node, will be added as edges (assuming that this
        other nodes are also in the graph g). Thus inserting node can
        create an arbitrary number of edges, from zero to N. If jump
        target is not yet in the graph, then jump is not removed from a
        sequence of jumps of the inserted node, but just ignored.


        {2 Updating nodes}

        When node is updated with the same node (but possibly with
        different set of terms, see {{!sema}description of sameness})
        then all changes that affects control flow will be
        applied. For example, if jump is absent in a new version of a
        block, and this jump corresponds to an edge in the graph, then
        this edge will be removed.

        {2 Removing nodes}

        The node will be removed from the underlying [sub term], and
        all edges incident to the removed node will be also removed.
        This will not affect jmp terms of blk terms.

        {2 Inserting edges}

        Edges in IR graph represents a transfer of a control flow
        between basic blocks. The basic block in IR is more reach,
        rather then a node in a graph. For example, in blk term the
        order of jumps matters. Jump [n] is taken, only if guard
        conditions of jumps [0] to [n-1] evaluated to [false] (like
        switch statement in C language). The order of edges in a graph
        is unspecified. So, some precaution should be taken, to handle
        edge removing and inserting correctly. Each edge is labeled
        with abstract label, that represents the jump position in a
        graph.

        When an edge is created it will look for corresponding jumps
        in source node. If there exists such jump, and it points to
        the destination, then it will be left untouched. If it points
        to a different node, then it will be fixed to point at the
        a given destination. If there is no position in a slot,
        represented by the a given label, then it will be
        inserted. Dummy jumps will be prepended before the inserted
        jump, if needed.

        When an edge is inserted into the graph, then source and
        destination nodes are inserted or updated (depending on whether
        they were already present in the graph). As a result, the
        graph must contain at least nodes, incident to the edge, and
        the edge itself.

        {2 Updating edge}

        Updating an edge is basically the same, as updating incident
        nodes, a given that the edge exists in the graph.


        {2 Removing edge}

        Removing an edge is not symmetric with edge insertion. It
        doesn't remove the incident nodes, but instead removes jumps
        from the source node to destination. The jumps are removed
        accurately, so that the order (and semantics) is preserved. If
        the removed jump was in the middle of the sequence then it is
        substituted by a dummy jump with [false] guard.

        {2 Semantics}

        {3 Grammar}

        The following syntactic forms are used in propagation rules:

        [*a] - load from address [a], where [a] is immediate value;
        [*a <- v] - store value [v] at address [a];
        [exp ~> v] - expression reduces to value [v];
        [v -> t] - value [v] is tainted by a taint [t];
        [<bop>] - BIL binary operation or BIL concat expression;
        [<uop>] - BIL unary, extract or cast expression.


        {3 Rules}

        Value [v] is tainted by taint [t], denoted as [v -> t], if there
        exists a deriviation of the following rules, proving this fact.

        {v

    *a ~> v
    a -> t
    ---------------- :: p_load
    v -> t

    *a <- v
    v -> t
    ---------------- :: p_store
    a -> t

    v1 <bop> v2 ~> v3
    v1 -> t
    ----------------- :: p_bop_lhs
    v3 -> t

    v1 <bop> v2 ~> v3
    v2 -> t
    ----------------- :: p_bop_rhs
    v3 -> t

    <uop> v1 ~> v2
    v1 -> t
    ----------------- :: p_uop
    v2 -> t

    v}

        Note 1: this class overrides only methods, that computes non-leaf
        expressions, leaving a space for extension for derived classes.

        Note 2: we do not propagate taint from condition to branches in the
        if/then/else expression, since we're propagating only data
        dependency, not control dependency.

        Although, one can argue, that in expression [if c then x else y]
        the result depends on [c], since if we change [c] we will get
        different results, there is a good reason for not propagating this
        dependency - the consistency with BIR and BIL. Consider, BIL's
        [if] statement or BIR's conditional jump. If we will start to
        propagate taint from condition in [ite] expression, then we should
        also propagate it in BIL's and BIR's conditionals. Unfortunatelly
        the latter is not possible.

        The input variables, are represented with stream of
        values. Basically, they can be viewed as cells, that depends
        on some input. When input changes, the value is recomputed and
        passed to the stream. Circular dependencies are allowed, so a
        rooter may actually depend on the [program] term. In case of
        circular dependencies, the above algorithm will be run
        iteratively, until a fixpoint is reached. A criterium for the
        fixpoint, is when no data need to be recomputed. And the data
        must be recomputed when its input is changed or needs to be
        recomputed.

        User provided input can depend on any information, but a good
        start is the information provided by the {!Info} module. It
        contains several variables, that are guaranteed to be defined
        in the process of reconstruction.

        For example, let's assume, that a [create_source] function
        actually requires a filename as its input, to create a source
        [t], then it can be created as easily as:

        [Stream.map Input.file ~f:create_source]

        As a more complex, example let's assume, that a source now
        requires that both [arch] and [file] are known. We can combine
        two different streams of information with a [merge] function:

        [Stream.merge Input.file Input.arch ~f:create_source], where
        [create_source] is a function of type: [string -> arch -> t].

        If the source requires more than two arguments, then a
        [Stream.Variadic], that is a generalization of a merge
        function can be used. Suppose, that a source of information
        requires three inputs: filename, architecture and compiler
        name. Then we first define a list of arguments,

        [let args = Stream.Variadic.(args Input.arch $Input.file $Compiler.name)]

        and apply them to our function [create_source]:

        [Stream.Variadic.(apply ~f:create_source args].


        Sources, specified in the examples above, will call a [create_source]
        when all arguments changes. This is an expected behavior for
        the [arch] and [file] variables, since the do not change during
        the program computation. Mixing constant and non-constant
        (with respect to a computation) variables is not that easy, but
        still can be achieved using [either] and [parse] combinators.
        For example, let's assume, that a [source] requires [arch] and
        [cfg] as its input:

        {[
          Stream.either Input.arch Input.cfg |>
          Stream.parse inputs ~init:nil ~f:(fun create -> function
              | First arch -> None, create_source arch
              | Second cfg -> Some (create cfg), create)
        ]}

        In the example, we parse the stream that contains either
        architectures or control flow graphs with a state of type,
        [cfg -> t Or_error.t]. Every time an architecture is changed,
        (i.e., a new project is started), we recreate a our state,
        by calling the [create_source] function. Since, we can't
        proof, that architecture will be decided before the [cfg], or
        decided at all we need to provide an initial [nil] function.
        It can return either a bottom value, e.g.,
        [let nil _ = Or_error.of_string "expected arch"]

        or it can just provide an empty information.

        [pass] over a project.

        pass automatically. If [runonce] is true, then for a given
        project the pass will be run only once. Each repeating
        attempts to run the pass will be ignored. The [runonce]
        parameter defaults to [false] when [autorun] is [false], and
        to [true] otherwise.

        Parameter [deps] is list of dependencies. Each dependency is a
        name of a pass, that should be run before the [pass]. The
        dependencies will be run in a specified order every time the
        [pass] is run.

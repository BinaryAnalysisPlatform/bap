(** Memory map.

    Memory map is an assosiative data structure that maps memory
    regions to values. Unlike in the Table, memory
    regions in the Memmap can intersect in an arbitrary ways. This
    data structure is also known as Interval Tree or Segmented Tree.

    Underneath the hood it is implemented using augumented AVL tree,
    so that all operations are logarithmic.

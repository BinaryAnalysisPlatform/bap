(** A repository of s-expressions.

    The repository holds an information about s-expressions loaded
    from files. The s-expression representation is indexed, and with
    each sub-tree of the s-expression we associate two indexes: the
    identity index and the equality index.

    The identity index uniquely identifies a tree, and location
    information is associated with each identity. The equality index
    represents structural equality and is in fact the ordinal number
    of the tree equivalence class in the quotient set by the
    structural equality. In other words, if two trees have the same
    equality index, then they are structurally equal.

    The source repository implements hashconsing, i.e., all trees with
    the same structure share the same memory regions.

    Note: despite the name the module doesn't have any dependencies on
    Primus Lisp, and works purely on the s-expression level. Later, we
    will move it into a separate library, along with the index and
    location modules. *)

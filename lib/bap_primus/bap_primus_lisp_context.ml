(* OLD: [C <= C'] iff for each class c in C, there is a class c' in C'
   such that c >= c', where c >= c' is a superset operation.

   This implies that the set of classes in C is a subset of the set of
   classes in C', since all missing classes can be introduced as
   classes with an empty feature sets. Intuitively, that denotes that
   a definition implicitly states that it is applicable to all
   instances of a missing class.
*)


(* NEW: X <= Y if X is less-specific than Y, i.e., if for each
   class x in X we have a class y in Y so that F(x) is a subset
   of F(y), where F(.) is the set of features.

   When a class is not present in the context we assume that it has an
   empty set of features.

   A definition that has context D is applicable in project that has
   context P if D <= P, i.e., if D is less specific or is as specific
   as P, so that for each feature requested by D we have a matching
   feature in P.

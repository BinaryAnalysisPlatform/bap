        The Primus Framework is built on top of the Machine
        observation. The Machine components make their own
        observations, based on observation made by other components.

        A value of type ['a observation] is a first-class
        representation of an event of type ['a]. While machine
        components are functors, the values of type observation should
        not depenend on the type of the functor.*)

      (** Primus Interpreter Context.

          Although it is possible to extend the Context class via the
          inheritence it is not recommended, as the Primus framework
          provides more composable way to extend the interpreter
          state. See the {!State} module for more information.


          A value of type [#t] can be accessed in the machine
          operation (an operation in the Machine monad), by the virtue
          of the [get ()] operation. The context can be changed with
          the [put ctxt] operation.

          [new ~envp ~argv ~main proj] creates a fresh new
          context. The [envp] is an array of environemnt
          variables. The representation depends on a system, but
          usually it is an array of [name=value]
          bindings. Correspondingly, the [argv] is an array of the
          program arguments. The [main] argument, if present, defines
          a function that is considered the entry point to a program.

          Note: it is usually not necessary to create a new context
          manually, unless you are implementing a new instatiation of
          a framework.*)
      class t :
        ?envp: string array ->

    (** Primus Machine.

        The Machine is the core of Primus Framework.  The Machine
        behavior is extended/changed with Machine Components. A
        component is a functor that takes a machine instance, and
        registers reactions to different events, that can happen
        during the machine evaluation. Events can be obtained from the
        observations made by the core components of the Machine, such
        as the Interpreter, or by other components, if their
        implementors provided any observations.

        A machine is usually instantiated and ran only once. For
        example, the [run] analysis creates a machine parameterized by
        the static model of a binary and runs a machine from the
        specified entry point, until it terminates.

        The user analysis is usually written in a form of a component,
        and is registered with the [register_component] function.*)

      (** Machine State.

          Any component can have it own state. In fact, components can
          have global state and local state.

          The Primus Machine is a non-deterministic Machine that can
          have multiple states at once. Basically, every time a
          non-deterministic event happens a machine can be forked
          (cloned). The [Global] state is shared across all clones of a
          machine, and can be used as a communication channel between
          the clones. Each clone has its own copy of the local state,
          that doesn't interfere with the state of other clones.

    (** Lisp machine.

        The Lisp Machine is an extensible Lisp Machine embedded into
        the Primus Machine. The Lisp machine is used to provide
        function stubs (summaries), as well as to control the Primus
        Machine using a dialect of Lisp.

        {1 Primus Lisp Language}

        {2 Overview}

        Primus Lisp is a dialect of Lisp, that can be used to interact
        with a native program. Primus Lisp is close to Common Lisp and
        to the Emacs Lisp dialect.

        Primus Lips is a low-level language, that doesn't provide many
        abstractions, as it tries to be as close to the machine
        language as possible. In that sense Primus Lisp can be seen as
        an assembler, except that it can't really assemble binaries,
        as it operates over already existing and assembled
        program. Primus Lisp, however is still quite powerfull, as the
        absence of suitable abstractions is compensated with powerful
        and versatile meta-programming system.

        Primus Lisp is primarily used for the following tasks:
        - writing function summaries (aka stubs);
        - setting up program environment;
        - exploring and observing program behavior.


        A Primus Lisp program is a file, that can contain the
        following entities:
        - feature requests;
        - declarations;
        - constants
        - substitutions;
        - macros;
        - functions;
        - advice

        The entities may be specified in any order, however the above
        order constitutes a good programming practice.

        Each file provides (implements) a feature, that has the same
        name as the name of the file without an extension and
        directories. Thus the namespace of features is flat. A feature
        is usually a function, macro definition, or any other
        definition, or a collection of definition, gathered under the
        same theme. For example, the [getopt] feature implements C
        [getopt] function, and accompanying definitions. The features
        maybe very specific, i.e., providing an implementation for
        only one small function, or they can be a collection of other
        features. For example, the [posix] feature provides an
        implementation of all functions specified in the POSIX
        standard (not all at the time of writing).

        A collection of files is called library.  To use features
        provided by another file, the file should be requested with
        the [(require <name>)] form, where [<name>] is the name of the
        feature. A file with the requested name is searched in the
        library, and loaded, making all its definitions available in
        the lexical scope, that follows the [require] form. If a
        feature is already provided, then nothing
        happens. Dependencies should not contain cycles.

        Declarations specify attributes that are shared by all
        definitions in a file.For example, a declaration

        {v (declare (context (arch armv7)) v}

        makes all definitions visible only in the context of the ARMv7
        architecture.

        Constants and substitutions are primitive abstractions that
        give names to code fragments. Macros are program
        transformations. Functions add parameters to a code, and are
        basic building blocks. Scope of all definitions can be limited
        with the context declarations. Finally, a function can be
        advised with another function using the [advice-add] function.


        {2 Type system}

        A type defines all possible values of an expression. In Primus
        Lisp, expression values can be only scalar, i.e., machine
        words of different widths. The width is always specified in
        the number of bits. A maximum width of a word is equal to the
        width of the architecture machine word, thus a family of types
        is dependent on the context of evaluation. (Note, current
        implementation limits maximum width of the machine word to 64
        bits). We denote a type of expression with a decimal number,
        e.g., [(exp : 16)] means that an expression ranges over all 16
        bit words.

        An expression can have a polymorphic type [t] that denotes a
        powerset of all types for the given architecture. For example,
        for ARMv7, {v t = 32 \/ 31 \/ .. \/ 1 v}. Thus a value of any
        type, is a also a value of type [t].

        Side note -- the type system doesn't include the unit type,
        i.e., the [0] type. An expression [()] evaluates to the [0:1]
        value.

        {2 Functions and expressions}

        Functions are named abstractions of code, where a code is a
        sequence of expressions. Since a value of an expression is
        a machine word, functions are not first-class values in Primus
        Lisp. However, functions and types can be manipulated on the
        meta-programming level.

        A function is defined with the [defun] form, that has the
        following syntax:

        {[
           (defun <name> (<p1> <p2> ... <pM>)
              <e1> <e2> .. <eN>)
        ]}

        A function definition may optionally contain a documentation
        strings and a declaration section. For example,

        {[
         (defun strlen (p)
           "returns a length of the null-terminated string pointed by P"
           (declare (external "strlen"))
           (msg "strlen was called with $p")
           (let ((len 0))
             (while (not (points-to-null p))
               (incr len p))
             len))
        ]}

        A function can be called (applied) using the function
        application form:

        {v (<function-name> <e1> <e2> ... <eM>) v}

        The first element of the function application form is not an
        expression and must be an identified. The rest arguments are
        expressions, that are evaluated from left to right. All
        arguments are passed by value.

        The body of a function is a sequence of expressions, that is
        evaluated in the lexical order (i.e., from top to down). A
        value of the last expression is the result of the function
        evaluation. An expression is either a function application or
        or a special form. Primus Lisp defines only 5 special forms,
        the rest of the syntax is defined using the macro system.

        {3 Choice}

        The {v (if <cond> <e1> <e2> .. <eM>) v} form is a basic
        control flow structure. If <cond> evaluates to a non-zero word
        then the result of the <if> form is the result of the <e1>
        expression. Otherwise, a sequence of expressions

        {v <e2> .. <eM> v} is evaluated and the result of the [if]
        form is the result of the last expression {v <eM> v}.


        Several derived forms are defined as macros, e.g.,

        {[
         (when <cond> <body>)
         (or <e1> <e2> .. <eM>)
         (and <e1> <e2> .. <eM>)
        ]}

        {3 Loops}

        Iterations can be implemented either using recursion or with
        the [while] special form. Since the interpreter doesn't
        provide the tail-call optimization it is better to use the
        latter (although the interpreter itself is using a constant
        stack size, as it uses the host language heap memory to
        represent the Primus Lisp call stack).

        The {v (while <cond> <e1> <e2> ..<eM>) v} form, will evaluate
        the <cond> expression first, and if it is a non-zero value,
        then the sequence of expressions {v <e1> .. <eM> v} is
        evaluated, and the value of the last expression becomes the
        value of the [while] form. If the value of the <cond>
        expression is not a zero, then this value becomes the value of
        the [while] form.


        {3 Variables}

        The [let] form binds values to names in the lexical scope.

        {v (let ((<v1> <e1>) .. (<vM> <eM>) <s1> .. <sN>) v}

        form binds variables {v <v1>, ... <vM > v} to values of
        expressions {v <e1>, ..., <eM> v} in expressions
        {v <s1>,...,<sN> v}.  The lexical scope of the bound variable
        starts from the next binding expression and ends with the
        scope of the whole let expression. Thus, a variable <v1> is
        bound in expressions {v <e2>,..., <eM> v} as well as in
        {v <s1>,..., <sN> v}.

        The value of the [let] form is the value of the last
        expression {v <sN> v}.


        {3 Sequencing }

        The {v (prog <e1> ... <eM>) v} form combines a sequence of
        expressions into one expression, and is useful in the contexts
        where an expression is required. The expressions are evaluated
        from left to right, and the value of the [prog] form is the
        value of the last expression.

        {3 Messaging }

        The {v (msg <fmt> <e0> <eM>) v} form constructs
        logging/debugging messages using an embedded formatting
        language. The formed message will be sent to the logging
        facility, that was set up during the Primus Lisp library
        initialization.

        The format language interprets all symbols literally, unless
        they start with the dollar sign ($).

        A pair of characters of the form {v $<n> v}, where {v <n> v}
        is a decimal digit, will be substituted with the value of the
        n'th expression (counting from zero).

        A sequence {v $<expr> v} will be substituted with the value of
        expression {v $<expr> v}. Thus the [$] symbol can be seen as
        an anti-quotation, that temporary disables the quoting marks.

        Example,

        {v (msg "hello, $0 $0 world, (+ 7 8) = $(+ 7 8)" "cruel") v}

        will be rendered to a message:

        {v "hello, cruel cruel world, (+ 7 8) = 15" v}


        {2 Metaprogramming}

        Ordinary Primus Lisp expressions are evaluated at the runtime
        in the Primus emulator, and are quite limited as they need to
        be evaluated directly on the CPU model. To mitigate this
        limitation, Primus Lisp provides a powerful metaprogramming
        system. The metaprogram is evaluated when the Primus Lisp
        program is read. A metaprogram generates a program, that will
        be evaluated by the CPU. The metaprogram itself is Turing
        complete, thus any transformation can be applied to a
        program. The Primus Lisp metaprogramming system use
        term-rewriting as a computational model, with Lisp code
        fragments as terms. Primus Lisp provides three facilities for
        metaprogramming:

        - syntactic constants;
        - syntactic substitutions;
        - macro definitions.

        {3 Constants}

        The syntactic constants is the simplest syntactic
        substitution, it just substitutes atoms for atoms. Constants
        are introduced with the [defconstant] form, that has the
        following syntax:

        {[
           (defconstant <name>
              [<docstring>]
              [<declarations>]
              <value>)
        ]}

        For example,

        {v (defconstant main-address 0xDEAD) v}


        During the program parsing, each occurrence of the
        {v <name> v} term will be rewritten with the {v <value> v}
        term, that should be an atom.



        {3 Substitutions}

        The syntactic substitutions is the generalization of syntactic
        constant, and has quite a similar syntax:

        {[
           (defsubst <name> [<declarations>] [:<syntax>] {<value>})
        ]}


        During parsing, every occurrence of the term {v <name> v} (that
        should be an atom), will be rewritten with a sequence of
        values {[ {<value>} ]}.

        Example,

        {v (defsubst ten-digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) v}

        A process of applying of the substitutions is called
        "expansion". Since the expansion transforms an atom to a list
        of atoms, it can be applied only inside the macro or function
        application. For example,

        {v (+ ten-digits) v}

        will be expanded to

        {v (+ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ) v}

        {4 Special syntax}

        Expansions also provide a support for extensible value
        specification syntax, that enables domain-specific data
        specification languages. Currently, we support only two
        syntaxes: [:ascii] and [:hex].

        In the [:ascii] syntax the values should be atoms, possibly
        delimited with double quotes. Each character of each atom will
        be expanded to its corresponding ASCII code. Strings can
        contain special characters prefixed with a backslash. The
        special character can be one of the well-known ASCII special
        character, e.g., [\n], [\r], etc, or it can be a decimal or a
        hexadecimal code of a character.

        Example, given the following substitution:

        {v (defsubst hello-cruel-world :ascii "hello, cruel world\n\000") v}

        the following application:

        {v (write-block SP hello-cruel-world v}

        will be expanded with

        {[
         (write-block SP
              0x68 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f 0x2c 0x20 0x63
              0x72 0x75 0x65 0x6c 0x20 0x77 0x6f 0x72
              0x6c 0x64 0x0a 0x00)
        ]}


        In the [:hex] syntax the sequence of atoms is split into
        two-characters subsequences each treated as a hex value. This
        syntax is useful for encoding memory dumps in a format that is
        close to the hexdump (without offsets). E.g., given the
        following substitution rule

        {[
         (defsubt example :hex 68656c 6c 6f2c2063)
        ]}

        an application

        {[
         (write-block SP example)
        ]}

        will be expanded into

        {[
         (write-block SP 0x68 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f 0x2c 0x20 0x63)
        ]}


        {3 Macro}

        The macros provide the most versatile and powerful way to
        specify arbitrary code transformations. The macro definitions
        introduce abstractions on the meta-programming level. I.e., it
        allows a programmer to write a function that operates on code
        terms, making the code a first class value.


        The macro definition has the following syntax:

        {[

         (defmacro <name> (<p1> ... <pM>)
           [<docstring>] [<declarations>]
           <value>)
        ]}

        A macro definition adds a term rewriting rule, that rewrites
        each occurrence of {v (<name> <t1> .. <tN>) v}, where [N >= M]
        with the {v <value> v} in which occurrences of the parameter
        <pN> is substituted with the term <tN>. If [N] is bigger than
        [M], then the last parameter is bound with the sequence
        {v <tM>...<tN> v}.

        The macro subsystem doesn't provide any specific looping or
        control-flow facilities, however, the macro-overloading
        mechanism along with the recursion make it possible to encode
        arbitrary meta-transformations.

        Other than a standard context-based ad-hoc overloading
        mechanism, the macro application uses arity-based
        resolution. As it was described above, if a number of
        arguments is greater than the number of parameters, then the
        last parameter is bound to the rest of the arguments. When
        several macro definitions matches, then a definition that has
        fewer unmatched arguments is chosen. For example, suppose we
        have the following definitions:

        {[
          (defmacro list-length (x) 1)
          (defmacro list-length (x xs) (+ 1 (list-length xs)))
        ]}


        The the following term

        {v (list-length 1 2 3) v}

        will be normalized (after a series of transformations) with
        the following:

        {v (+ 1 (+ 1 1)) v}


        {[
1: (list-length 1 2 3) => (+ 1 (list-length 2 3))
2: (+ 1 (list-length 2 3)) => (+ 1 (+ 1 (list-length 3)))
3: (+ 1 (+ 1 (list-length 3))) => (+ 1 (+ 1 1))
        ]}

        In the first step, both definition match. In the first
        definition [x] is bound to [1 2 3], while in the second
        [x] is bound to [1] and [xs] is bound to [2 3]. Since the last
        parameter is bound to fewer arguments, the second definition
        is chosen as the most certain. In the second step the second
        definition is still more concrete. Finally at the last step,
        the second definition doesn't match at all, as it has more
        parameters than arguments.


        A slightly more complex example, is a fold iterator, that
        applies a function to a sequence of arguments  of arbitrary
        length, e.g.,

        {[
        (defmacro fold (f a x) (f a x))
        (defmacro fold (f a x xs) (fold f (f a x) xs))
        ]}


        Using this definition we can define a sum function (although
        it is not needed as the [+] function defined in the Primus Lisp
        standard library, already accepts arbitrary number of
        arguments), as:

        {v (defmacro sum (xs) (fold + 0 xs)) v}

        The {v (sum 1 2 3) v} will be rewritten as follows:

        {[
1: (sum 1 2 3) => (fold + 0 1 2 3)
2: (fold + 0 1 2 3) => (fold + (+ 0 1) 2 3)
3: (fold + (+ 0 1) 2 3) => (fold + (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3)
4: (fold + (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3) => (+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3)
        ]}

        A more real example is the [write-block] macro, that takes a
        sequence of bytes, and writes them starting from the given
        address:

        {[
        (defmacro write-block (addr bytes)
          (fold memory-write addr bytes))
        ]}

        The definition uses the [memory-write] primitive, that writes
        a byte at the given address and returns an address of the next
        byte.


        {2 Polymorphism}

        Primus Lisp provides both kinds of polymorphism: parametric
        and ad hoc.

        Expressions in Primus Lisp have types, that are denoted with
        natural numbers starting with one. Each type defines a set of
        values that can be represented with the given number of
        bits. Values with different widths are different, even if they
        represent the same number. Expressions can be polymorphic,
        e.g., function

        {v (defun square (x) ( * x x)) v}

        has type `forall n. n -> n -> n`. Thus it can be applied to
        values of different types, e.g., [(square 4:4)], that will be
        evaluated to the [0:4] value, or [(square 4:8)], that will be
        evaluated to [16:8], etc. The parametric polymorphism doesn't
        require any special annotations or type specifications so we
        will not stop on it anymore.


        The ad hoc polymorphism provides a facilities for overloading
        definitions. That is, the same entity may have multiple
        definitions, and depending on a context, only one definition
        should be chosen. Not only functions can have multiple
        definitions, but also macros, constants, and
        substitutions. Since the latter three entities operate on the
        syntactic level, the syntax of Primus Lisp itself is
        context-dependent.

        {3 Context}

        A context (from the perspective of the type system) is a set
        of type class instances. The context is fixed when a program
        is parsed. A Primus Lisp program may not change the context;
        neither in runtime, nor it the parse time, thus a program is
        parsed and evaluated at the specific context. However, a
        definition may declare that it makes sense only in some
        context. If more than one definition make sense under the
        given context, then the most specific one is chosen. If no
        definition is more specific than another, then an error
        occurs.

        A type class defines a type as a set of features. The subset
        relation induces a subtyping relation over types - a type [t']
        is a subtype of a type [t] if [t' <= t] (i.e., if [t'] is a
        subset of [t]). Each feature is a textual tag, called a
        feature constructor.

        The context declaration limits an associated definition to the
        specified type class(es), and has the following syntax:

        {[
          (declare (context <type-class-name> {<feature-constructor>}))
        ]}

        Let's use the following two definitions for a concrete example,

        {[
           (defmacro get-arg-0 ()
             (declare (context (arch arm gnueabi)))
             R0)

           (defmacro get-arg-0 ()
             (declare (context (arch x86 cdecl)))
             (read-word word-width (+ SP (sizeof word-width))))
        ]}


        We have two definitions of the same macro [get-arg-0], that
        are applicable to different contexts. The first definition,
        is only applicable in the context of the ARM architecture and
        the gnueabi ABI. The second is applicable in the context of
        the x86 architecture and the cdecl ABI. More formally, a
        definition is considered only if its context is a subtype of
        the current type context.

        {2 Advice mechanism}

        Primus Lisp also provides a mechanism for non-intrusive
        extending existing function definitions. An existing
        definition maybe advised with another definition. A piece of
        advice maybe added to a function, and will be called either
        before, or after the function evaluation, e.g.,

        {[
        (defun memory-written (a x) (msg "write $x to $a"))
        (advice-add memory-written :after memory-write)
        ]}

        The general syntax is:

        {v (advice-add <advisor> <when> <advised>) v}

        where the <when> clause is either [:before] or [:after].

        {2 Formal syntax}

        Each entity is an s-expression with the grammar, specified
        below.We use BNF-like syntax with the following conventions.
        Non-terminal symbols are denoted like <this>, square brackets
        denote optional components, and curly brackets denote zero,
        one, or several repetitions of the enclosed component. Ordinary
        parentheses do not bear any notation, and should be read
        literally. Note, since the grammar is not context free, and is
        extensible, the following is an approximation of the language
        grammar. Grammar extension points are defined as '..' in the
        production definition.

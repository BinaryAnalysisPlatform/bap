(** Primus - The Microexecution Framework.


Primus is a microexecution framework that can be used to build
CPU and full system emulators, symbolic executers, static
fuzzers, policy checkers, tracers, quickcheck-like test suites,
etc.

The underlying idea is quite simple - Primus interprets a lifted
program. The interpreter provides a set of extension points
through which it is possible to observe what is happening inside
the interpreter, and even to change the interpreter
behavior. This extension points are called "observations" in
Primus parlance. A simple publish/subscriber architecture is
used to watch for the interpreter events, where subscribers are
allowed to arbitrary change the interpreter state.

A novel idea is that the interpreter is non-deterministic
in the same sense as a non-deterministic Turing machine. That
means that any computation may have more than one result. Every
time there is a non-determinism in the computation the machine
state is cloned. Different scheduling policies mixed with
different non-deterministic startegies provide an analyst a vast
selection of avenues to investigate.

Primus is build around an idea of a component base linearly
extensible interpreter. That means, that an analysis can be
built from basic building blocks, with minimal coupling between
them. The central component is the Interpreter itself. It
evaluates a program and interacts with three other components:
 - Linker
 - Env
 - Memory

The Linker is responsible for linking code into the program
abstraction. The [Env] component defines the environment
behavior, i.e., variables. Finally, the [Memory] component is
responsible for the memory representation.

Primus framework is implemented as a monad transformer that
wraps any monad into the [Machine] monad. The [Machine] monad
denotes a computation, and is implemented as a composition of
state, exception, and continuation passing monad.

Each user component is a functor that is parametrized by a
Machine monad. It is require to provide only one function -
[init]. Usually, this function subscribes to observations, but
it can modify other components (depending on their interface).

  (** Machine Observation.

        The Primus Framework is built on top of the Machine
        observation. The Machine components make their own
        observations, based on observation made by other components.

        A value of type ['a observation] is a first-class
        representation of an event of type ['a]. While machine
        components are functors, the values of type observation should
        not depenend on the type of the functor.*)
  module Observation : sig

    (** An observation provider.
          A provider facilitates introspection of the Primus Machine,
          for the sake of debugging and dumping the effects. The
          provider shoud not (and can't be) used for affecting the
          behavior of a machine, or for the analysis, as its main
          purpose is debugging, logging, and tracing the execution.*)
    type provider


    (** [provide ?inspect name] returns a pair of two handlers. The
          first element is used to observe values, the second is used
          to provide values for the observation.

          The [inspect] function may provide a sexp representation of
          an observed value, that will be used for introspection and
          pretty-printing (it is not required, and if it is provided, it
          is not necessary to disclose everything *)

    val list_providers : unit -> provider list


    (** Data interface to the provider.

          This interface provides access to the data stream of all
          providers expresses as a stream of s-expressions.
     *)
    module Provider : sig
      type t = provider

      (** unique name of a provider *)
      val name : t -> string

      (** a total number of observers that subscribed to this provider  *)
      val observers : t -> int

      (** triggers a stream of occurences of this observation  *)
      val triggers : t -> unit stream

      (** a data stream from this observation *)
      val data : t -> Sexp.t stream
    end
  end

  (** Primus Machine.

        The Machine is the core of Primus Framework.  The Machine
        behavior is extended/changed with Machine Components. A
        component is a functor that takes a machine instance, and
        registers reactions to different events, that can happen
        during the machine evaluation. Events can be obtained from the
        observations made by the core components of the Machine, such
        as the Interpreter, or by other components, if their
        implementors provide any observations.

        A machine is usually instantiated and ran only once. For
        example, the [run] analysis creates a machine parameterized by
        the static model of a binary and runs a machine from the
        specified entry point, until it terminates.

        The user analysis is usually written in a form of a component,
        and is registered with the [register_component] function.*)

          initialized, and before the execution starts*)
    val init : unit observation

    (** The [finished] event occurs when the machine terminates.   *)
    val finished : unit observation

    (** [exn_raised exn] occurs every time an abnormal control flow
          is initiated *)
    val exn_raised : exn observation


    (** [raise exn] raises the machine exception [exn], intiating
            an abonormal control flow *)
    val raise : exn -> 'a t


    (** [catch x f] creates a computation that is equal to [x] if
            it terminates normally, and to [f e] if [x] terminates
            abnormally with the exception [e]. *)

              (exit_status * knowledge, conflict) result


    (** Machine State.

          Any component can have its own state. In fact, components
          can have a global state and a local state.

          The Primus Machine is an implementation of the
          Non-deterministic abstract machine, and thus can have more
          than one state. Basically, every time a non-deterministic
          event happens a machine can be forked (cloned). The [Global]
          state is never replicated, and a machine can have only one
          global state, that is shared across all clones of a machine,
          and can be used as a communication channel between the
          clones. The [local] state is duplicated at each clone. *)

      (** ['a t] is a type of state that holds a value of type
            ['a], and can be constructed from the base context of type

          components are initialized is not specified, but since all

          matter).

  (** Machine Memory.

        Provides storage facilities. A machine can have multiple memories,
        e.g., RAM, ROM, HDD, cache, register files, etc. They are all accessed
        via the unified memory inteface using [get] and [set]  primitives wich
        read and store bytes from the current memory. The current memory could
        be switched with the [switch] operation and its descriptor could be
        queried using the [memory] operation.

        Each memory device has an independent address space and address bus width
        (which could be different from the virtual memory address size).
        Each memory could be segmented and can have its own TLB, which is usually
        implemented via the [pagefault] handlers.

(** Microexecution library.

    Microexecution is an execution of arbitrary pieces of code,
    under random context.

    The library provides two classes:

    - a concretizer
      concretization is a process of giving a value for unknown
      variable);
    - a conqueror, that is an IR interpreter, that tries to cover as
      much code as needed.

  (** BIL

      This module captures BIL language definitions. Do not open
      this module globally, since it may override common OCaml
      functions. Actually, opening this module is a way of
      switching from OCaml language into a BIL embedded DSL, for
      example:

      {[
        Bil.([
            v := exp_of_op src lsr int32 1;
            r := exp_of_op src;
            s := int32 31;
            while_ (var v <> int32 0) [
              r := var r lsl int32 1;
              r := var r lor (var v land int32 1);
              v := var v lsr int32 1;
              s := var s - int32 1;
            ];
            dest := var r lsl var s;
          ])
      ]}

      In the above example, all operators, e.g., [lsl], [-], [<>],
      are from the BIL language, and the result of the above
      expression is a value of type [Bil.t].

      To summarize, this module includes:
      - all constructors
      - all infix and prefix operators of BIL
      - a set of functional constructors
      - BIL visitors
      - BIL helper functions

      This module also implements [Sexpable], [Binable] and
      [Printable] interfaces for the [bil] type aka [stmt list].
      This interfaces allow you to print, store and read BIL in
      different formats. There is also a standalone [Bil_piqi]
      module that provides a family of functions to store and load
      BIL in different formats, supported by piqi library. See,
      [bap-mc] application for examples of serializing BIL into
      different formats.

      The [Regular] interface for the [bil] type is not provided for
      intention, to prevent from creating [Bil.Map], [Bil.Table] or
      other structures, that inefficient by their nature.

      If you're looking for the [Regular] interface for BIL
      expressions and statements, then [Exp] and [Stmt] modules below
      are for you. E.g., [Exp.(x = y)] will compare two expressions
      and will evaluate to the [bool] type. [Bil.(x = y)] results in
      a symbolic comparison of two expressions and will evaluate to a
      BIL expression.

    (** This submodule is useful if all you want is to get access
        to constructor names (for example for pattern matching).
        If opened this module will bring to the namespace only
        constructor names and types. Types will have the same name
        as corresponding module, e.g. [cast], [binop], [unop].
        It is quite safe to open this module globally. *)

    (** {4 Infix operators}

        Every BIL expression or statement is mapped to the
        corresponding OCaml operator. Signed forms of operations
        a build with appending [$] sign to the original operator,
        e.g., signed division is [/%]. Exception, signed modulo
        is [%$].

        Move statement has an infix form of the assignment operator,
        i.e., [:=]. *)

    include Infix

    (** {4 Functional constructors}

        For each constructor there is the same named function, c.f.,
        [variantslib] library, but with some exceptions summarized below.

        In general constructors are mapped to the same named
        functions, e.g.,   [Move of var * exp] is mapped to
        [move : var -> exp -> stmt].

        Some complex constructors (especially those with many
        parameters of the same type) are mapped functions with keyword
        arguments, e.g., [Load of (exp * exp * endian * size)] is
        mapped to [load mem:exp -> addr:exp -> endian -> size -> exp].

        Constructors that results in a keywords, e.g., [While], [If],
        are escaped with trailing underscore, e.g., [while_], [if_].

  (** Bitvector is an ubiquitous module, that represents bitstrings and

      depending on a context, one should use [Addr] module and
      corresponding type to represent addresses, and [Word] module to
      denote other values. Although they all will point to the same
      type, it will be a little more explicit, and more understandable.

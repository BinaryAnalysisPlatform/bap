  Identifies function starts using a predefined sets of function
  start signatures. Each signature is a sequence of bytes equipped with
  a sample probability of occuring it as a function start. The input
  memory is scanned, and for each byte that is not yet classified as a
  function start the longest sequence of bytes is searched in the
  signatures. If one is found, then the $(b,threshold) parameter defines
  the decision procedure. If it is a value below $(b,1.0) then the
  sequence of bytes will be classified as a function start if the
  the associated probability is higher than the specified threshold.
  If the threshold is greater or equal than 1.0, then the sequence of
  bytes will be classified as a function start if the Bayes factor of
  the two competing hypothesis is greater than the specified
  threshold. The Bayes factor is the ratio between the posterior
  probabilities of the competing hypothesis. Therefore, it includes
  the prior odds of finding a function start, which makes the
  hypothesis testing more robust. The Bayes factor value is having the
  following interpretations:

  algorithm is interprocedural, however it is not call graph

  approximation that any function can call any other, thus any
  variables that occurs free in any function is considered to be
  non-constant. The algorithm is, however, flow sensitive on the
  control flow graph level and uses the SSA form to encode data
  facts. Since, it is not always safe to rely on the control flow
  integrity and CFG precision, by default we optimize only flags and
  virtual variables under a presumption that those two kind of data
  points rarely used non-locally.

       it is not affected by the imprecision of a control flow graph.
       On level 2, we also move and optimize processor flags. This
       removes a significant amount of code and simplifies the program

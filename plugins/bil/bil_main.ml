        code of each machine instruction and is applied to the output
        of a lifter. Each piece of transformation is called $(i,a pass).
        This plugin enables full control over the pass selection as
        well as provides some predefined passes. See the
        $(b,--bil-list-passes) for a comprehensive list of available
        transformations. The pipeline is formed as a concatenation of
        all normalization passes that correspond to the selected level
        of normalization (setting it to zero will disable normalizations),
        all optimization passes applicable to the selected level of
        optimization (again the zero level corresponds to an empty
        list of optimizations), and all passes selected via the
        $(b,--bil-passes) command line argument. All passes are
        applied until a fixed point is reached (i.e., until the
        outcome of the pipeline is equal to the income) or until a
        loop is detected. Thus to prevent infinite looping each
        registered pass should be a pure function of its inputs (same
        input shall result in the same output).";

      The normalization process doesn't change the semantics of

      There are two BIL normal forms (bnf): bnf1 and bnf2, both
      of which are described in details in $(b,bap)(3).
      Briefly, $(b,bnf1) produce the BIL code  with load expressions
      that applied to a memory only. And $(b,bnf2) also adds some
      more restrictions like absence of let-expressions and makes
      load/store operations sizes equal to one byte.
      So, there are next possible options for normalization level:

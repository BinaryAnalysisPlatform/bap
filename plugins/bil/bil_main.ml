# DESCRIPTION

Defines the semantics of BAP Instruction Language (BIL) and makes old
BIL lifters available in the system. This plugin denotes the semantics
of the Core Theory in terms of BIL statements and expressions as well
as defines an interpretation of BIL programs in terms of the Core
Theory. The latter enables the old lifter to be seamlessly integrated
with the new knowledge framework.

The BIL code, obtained from the lifters is processed by the BIL
transformation pipeline to enable optimization and/or normalization of
BIL program.s

# THE BIL PIPELINE

The BIL transformation pipeline is used to transform the BIL code of
each machine instruction and is applied to the output of a BIL
lifter. Each piece of transformation is called $(i,a pass).  This
plugin enables full control over the pass selection as well as
provides some predefined passes. See the $(b,--bil-list-passes) for a
comprehensive list of available transformations. The pipeline is
formed as a concatenation of all normalization passes that correspond
to the selected level of normalization (setting it to zero will
disable normalizations), all optimization passes applicable to the
selected level of optimization (again the zero level corresponds to an
empty list of optimizations), and all passes selected via the
$(b,--bil-passes) command line argument. All passes are applied until
a fixed point is reached (i.e., until the outcome of the pipeline is
equal to the income) or until a loop is detected. Thus to prevent
infinite looping each registered pass should be a pure function of its
inputs (same input shall result in the same output).

A new pass could be registered via the $(b,Bil.register_pass)
function. It won't be automatically selected, so it should be
specified explicitly via the $(b,--bil-passes) command line
argument.

(** Basic generic loader that works more or less correctly for all
    architectures and abi.

    The loader performs the following tasks:

    - Loads memory segments, including the virtual one, sets up brk,
    end, edata, etext, and environ variables (see any unix man page
    for the description of these symbols). Note (edata and etext are not
    guaranteed, while end and brk are)

    - Adds CPU registers to the environment and initializes them with
    zero.

    - Set's the main frame (copies arguments from the ctxt to the
      stack)

    - Allocates a stack segment. The [stack_base] address points to
      the first byte beyond the end of the stack segment. The memory
      region between [[stack_base - stack_size, stack_base)] is the
      stack segment. Note, that the [stack_base] address doesn't
      belong to it. The memory is initialized to random values, and
      can be used to store automatic variables and pass arguments.

    After the image is loaded, the SP will point to the number of
    command line arguments, and the arguments will follow it, e.g.
    if an address size is 4 bytes, then SP+4 will point to the first
    argument (program name), SP+8 to the first specified command line
    argument, and so on. A null will follow the last argument. After
    that the same null terminated table of environemnt variables will
    follow. (It can be easy accessed via the [environ] symbol

    Note: the layout of the main function stack frame is not
    standartized in the C standard, neither it is a part of any ABI. A
    system loader may put arguments and environment variables in any
    place, including stack, heap, or, even, ROM. We chose to put it in
    the stack just above the stack_base address. As a result, the
    actual size of the stack is a little big biger, and it is possible
    to access to the memory that is beyond the stack_base address.

    {2 Intro}

    This module is the only one that needed to write lifter functions.
    The main idea is to make a life of lifter writers as easy as
    possible. This implies that only few lines of code should be
    enough to describe any instruction.

    We introduce RTL - the language we expect to be very expressive,
    with lots of details hidden under the hood, so a user should not
    care about minor details.

    So proposed usage is just to open at the very beginning of your
    module:

    {[
      open Powerpc.Std
    ]}

    {2 RTL}

    The central part of this module is RTL. It contains expressions,
    operations over expressions and statements.
    Basically, any line that ended with ';' is a (compound) statement,
    and any part of it is either a statement, expression(s), or operation over
    expression(s).

    {3 Bitwidth and Signedness}

    Any expression in RTL has a notion of signedness and bitwidth.

    If an operation is applied to expressions with different signs,
    any unsigned expression is implicitly casted to signed one.

    If an operation is applied to expressions with different bitwidths,
    an expression with the smaller bitwidth is implicitly casted
    (extended) to the bitwidth of another expression.

    {3 Expressions}

    There are only few ways to construct an expression:
     - from instruction operand
     - from constant
     - from string
     - by defining temporary variable

    To construct an expression that denotes a register and treat
    its content as an unsigned value, one should write:

    {v
     let ra = unsigned cpu.reg op.(0)
              -------- ------- ------
                 ^         ^      ^
                 |         |      |
      content is |         |      |
      unsigned __|         |      |
                           |      |
                 claim register  from operands array at index 0
    v}

    Immediate instructions operands are constructed in the same
    way:

    {[
      let im = signed imm op.(1)
    ]}

    Also one may create variables for convenience:

    {[
      let x = unsigned var halfword
    ]}

    that is a creation of variable of bitwidth 16. Other useful
    bitwidthes are bit, byte, word, doubleword, quadroword. And
    also it's possible to create a variable of arbitrary bitwidth:

    {[
      let x = signed var (bitwidth 10)
    ]}

    It's also possible to create an epxression from integer constant:

    {[
      let x = unsigned const word 42
    ]}

    And create an expression from string:

    {[
      let x = unsigned of_string "0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF"
    ]}

    {4 Extraction}

    There is a general way to extract a part of an expression:
    [extract exp from to], where a [from] denotes a more significant
    bit than [to].

    Also, there are few more convenient and readable ways to extract, e.g.:
    - [low word x]  - extract the last word from [x]
    - [high byte x] - extract first (the most significant) byte
    - [last x 5]    - extract last (the least significant) bits
    - [first x 2]   - extract second bit
    - [msb x]       - extract the most significant bit

    Note, that extraction of a bigger width from expression is
    also possible, see example below.

    Extraction always results to an unsigned expression. And
    sign bit interpretation depends on further using of a result
    expression. So don't use it for sign casting, just use
    expression as it is where signedness matter.

    Example 1. Apply extract explicitly. The result is 0x0000_FFFF.
    {[
     let x = signed const halfword 0xFFFF in
     let y = signed var word in
     RTL.[
       y := last word x;
     ];
    ]}

    Example 2. Assignment to signed, without extraction.
    The result is 0xFFFF_FFFF.
    {[
     let x = signed const halfword 0xFFFF in
     let y = signed var word in
     RTL.[
       y := x;
     ]
    ]}

    {4 Concatenation}

    Concatenation always return an unsigned expression. It's still
    possible to use a result as signed expressions, e.g. by assigning
    it to signed expression or use in signed binary/unary operation.

    {4 Operators}

    There are lot's math operators: [plus], [modulo], [less than] etc.
    All they take one or more expressions and also return expression:
    [x + y], [lnot y], [x lsl y] ...
    There are not any special signed versions of operators. But if
    signedness is matter, then use signed operands. Like in example
    below, [<] is a signed comparison:

    {[
      let x = signed const halfword 0xFAAA in
      let y = unsigned var bit in
      RTL.[
        y := x < zero;
      ]
    ]}

    The result is true (1), since [x] is signed. But if we will replace
    x definition to [unsigned const halfword 0xFFFF] then result will be
    false (0) and [<] will be unsigned comparison.

    The same is true for shift operators: [>>] and [<<].
    There are not separate logical shift operators. But shift is a
    logical one if operand is unsigned. And otherwise, shift is
    an arithmetical one if operand is signed.

    {[
      let x = signed const halfword 0xFAAA in
      let s = unsigned const halfword 4 in
      let y = unsigned var halfword in
      RTL.[
        y := x >> s;
      ]
    ]}
    If [x] is signed, like in example above, then shift is
    arithmetical, and result is 0xFFAA. If [x] is unsigned, then shift
    is logical and result is Ox0FAA.

    {4 Assignment}

    The only operator that takes an expression and returns a statement
    is an assignment. It is a very important and expressive operator
    in RTL. The right-hand side of an assignment is always treated to
    have the same sign and width as a left one:
    {[
      ra := zero;
      rb := rc ^ rd;
    ]}
    Assuming, that [zero] is just one bit and all [ra], [rb], [rc], [rd] are 32-bit
    expressions we will get [ra], with all bits set to zero, and [rb]
    equaled to [rd], since a concatenation [rc ^ rb] returns a 64 bit
    expression while we may assign only 32 bit.

    An expression in left hand side of assignment is always either of
    expressions:
     - constructed with var/reg constructors
     - all expressions from cpu model, except pc
     - extraction or concatenation of two cases above
    So there are few examples of correct assignment:

    {[
      low byte rt := ra + rb;
      cpu.cr := zero;
      nbit cpu.cr 1 := one;
    ]}


    {2 Bit,byte,whatever Order}

    Everywhere in this module, where a notion of bit position
    (byte,word ...) does matter, a numeration starts from
    the most significant bit (byte,word, ...).

    Example 1. [y] will be set to 0xAB, because first byte
    requested:
    {[
     let x = unsigned const halfword 0xABCD in
     let y = unsigned var byte in
     RTL.[
       y := first byte x;
     ];
    ]}

    Example 2. [y] will be set to 0xCD, because last byte
    requested:
    {[
     let x = unsigned const halfword 0xABCD in
     let y = unsigned var byte in
     RTL.[
       y := last byte x;
     ];
    ]}

    Example 3. [y] will be set to one, because second bit
    requested (numeration starts from zero):
    {[
     let x = unsigned of_string "0b010000" in
     let y = unsigned var bit in
     RTL.[
       y := nth bit x 1;
     ];
    ]}

    {2 Lifter}

    Any lifter function must have two arguments. The first one is
    a model of CPU that contains all information like registers,
    memory access, instruction address, etc. The second argument
    is an array of instruction operands, and it's a user responsibility
    to treat each element of this array according to instruction
    semantics. So, if the first operand of add instruction is a target
    register, the second operand is a source register, and the
    third operand is an immediate:
    {[
      let tar = signed cpu.reg ops.(0) in
      let src = signed cpu.reg ops.(1) in
      let imm = unsigned imm ops.(2) in
      RTL.[
        tar := src + imm;
      ]
    ]}

    {2 Misc}

    There are few useful constructions that either a part of RTL
    ([if_], [foreach]) or simplify code ([when_], [ifnot], [switch]).
    Also, one needs to register a lifted function, so
    it could be called when appropriative instruction will be
    encountered. There are two operators for this purpose:
    - [(|>)] - just registers a function (see example below)
    - [(|>.)] - does the same, plus does some extra job (see
             a description below)

    {2 Complete example}

    To be more concrete let's create an artificial example.
    {[
      1 let sort_of_add cpu ops =
      2   let rt = unsigned reg ops.(0) in
      3   let ra = signed reg ops.(1) in
      4   let im = unsigned imm ops.(2) in
      5   let rc = unsigned reg ops.(3) in
      6   let tm = signed var doubleword in
      7   let xv = unsigned const word 42 in
      8   let sh = unsinged const byte 2 in
      9   RTL.[
     10        rt := ra + im;
     11        tm = cpu.load rt halfword + xv;
     12        rc := (tm lsl sh) + cpu.ca;
     13    ]
     14   let () =
     15     "SomeSortOfAdd" >| sort_of_add;
    ]}

    There is a lifter for instruction [SomeSortOfAdd]. It's required
    it has two arguments: cpu model and operand array.
    An author read an ISA of Power PC architecture carefully and
    figured out that this instruction has four operands, and that the
    first, the second and the fourth argument are registers and the
    third one is an immediate. And instruction has the following
    semantics.
    An effective address is a sum of the content of [ra] register and
    immediate. An effective address is stored in [rt] register. A
    halfword stored at this address must be summed with 42, shifted
    left twice and summed with carry flag. And the result must be
    written to [rc] register.

    How did author implement lifter for this instruction:
    - [line 1] - defined a function with two arguments
    - [lines 2-5] - parsed instruction operands
    - [lines 6-8] - defined useful constants
    - [lines 9-13] - wrote RTL code for this instruction.
    - [lines 14-15] - registered lifter for this instruction

    What happens on each line of RTL code:
    - [line 10]: sum of signed [ra] and unsigned imm is a signed expression,
             because one of the operands is signed. But an unsigned
             result is placed in [rt], since [rt] is unsigned too.
    - [line 11]: load from memory at address from [rt] is summed with 42
             and assigned to variable [tm]. Note, there are two width
             extension under the hood: loaded halfword is extended to
             up to a word bitwidth (since it's a bigger bitwidth among
             sum operand) and than sum extended to a doubleword
             bitwidth with respect to a [tm] sign. So, the result of
             this sum is treated as a signed.
    - [line 12]: Logical shift returns an unsigned result which is summed
             with unsigned value. The interesting part is that it's
             safe to add one-bit value (flag is one bit width) and a
             doubleword.

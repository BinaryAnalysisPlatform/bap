    `P "A taint propagation framework, that uses microexecution to
    propagate the taint through a program. The execution is perfomed
    using the ConquEror Engine, that is short for Concrete Evaluation
    with Errors. This execution engine allows to run incomplete
    programs with an unspecified user input. Moreover, to increase the
    coverage it may take infeasible paths.";


    `P "The taint is propagated from a seed to its maximum extent. The
    seed is a definition point that is marked with a `Taint.reg` or
    `Taint.ptr` tag. A usual way of using the framework, would be to
    use one or more passes that marks points of interest with a taint
    seed, then to use the `propagate-taint` pass to propagate the
    taint, and, finally, to use a pass that will collect and analyze
    the result.";


    `P "The microexecution is performed over a lifted program using
    bap-microx library. Memory reads are intercepted and redirected to
    program image, if possible (for static data), otherwise they are
    concretized. All other inputs, like reads from unknown registers
    or user input are also concretized. Several concretization
    policies are provided:";

    `Pre "
      - Const - all unknown values are concretized to a specified constant;
      - Random - a random value is picked from a value domain;
      - Range - a random value is picked from a specified range.";

    `P "By default, the microexecution engine tries to visit all
    program branches. During the execution, it will record missed
    branches as checkpoints. When there is nothing more to explore, it
    will backtrack to a stored checkpoint, restoring the execution
    state at this program point, and continue the execution. Of
    course, in this case the state will contradict with a path
    constraint. In a deterministic mode the bactracking mechanism is
    disabled. In this mode, no checkpoints are recorded, and whenever
    the interpreter requests a backtracking, it will instead return
    from a current procedure.";

    `P "The maximum length of an execution path is limited with some
    constant number of jumps (basic blocks). Also, a loop escaping
    mechanism, will detect loops and bail out of them after a
    specified amount of iterations. In the deterministic mode it will
    just return from a procedure, otherwise, it will backtrack.";

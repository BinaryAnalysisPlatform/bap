(* The lifter provides the instruction semantics and has type
   [Theory.program KB.obj -> unit Theory.eff], or, the same
   type but using [Bap.Std] abbreviations,
   [tid -> insn knowledge].

   The only input parameter is a label that denotes a program
   location, aka a knowledge base object of type
   core:program. The label is like a generalized address - it
   uniquely identifies a program location, even across modules.

   To build the semantics the lifter can access various properties of
   the instruction. Accessing a property might trigger computations
   that associated with this property, e.g., the instruction will be
   disassembled if it wasn't yet. It is even possible to access the
   semantics property of the instruction (the property that the lifter
   is supposed to compute). Thus, the lifter could be a co-recursive
   function with other lifters (itself included, of course).

   The list of properties of that class  can be obtained using the
   following command: `bap list classes -f core:program`.

   The return type [unit Theory.eff] is the denotation of effects that
   the instruction performs. The ['a Theory.eff] type is an
   abbreviation for ['a Theory.effect], which, in turn, is an
   abbreviation to the knowledge base value of class
   [Theory.Effect.cls], therefore the fully de-abbreviated type of the
   return type is:

   [(Theory.Effect.cls, unit Theory.Effect.sort) KB.cls KB.value knowledge]

   The set of sorts that parameterize the class denote what kinds of
   effects the instruction can have. With the [Effect.top] effect,
   which is denoted with the [unit] type, being the sort of all sorts
   of effects that an instruction can possibly have. In other words,
   the return type of the lifter expects an object that can denote any
   effect.

   To build the denotations of effects the lifter function is using
   a theory object, which is created using [Theory.instance] and
   [Theory.require] functions. The theory is a structure that
   includes a lot of functions that comprise the [Theory.Core]
   signature. This functions can be seen as smart constructors that
   build denotations.

   In our example, we will build a denotation for only one instrucion,
   `LR` (for load register) that loads (moves) a value from one
   register to another.

   Our simple framework matches on the opcode name and calls corresponding
   function, which expects the decoded machine instruction as its
   input and produces the effect denotation.

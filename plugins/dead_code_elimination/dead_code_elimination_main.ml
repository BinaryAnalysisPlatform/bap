(* a simple constant propagation, that will propagate constant
   expressions from virtual variables that are assigned only once to
   the point of usage (if any).

   1. we propagate only virtuals since they are not used/clobbered by
      function calls. We can't touch real registers, as we don't know
      the calling convention. And even if we know, a malicious program
      may easily break it.

   2. instead of a full-fledges reaching definition analysis we are
      relying on a simple over-approximation: if a variable is defined
      only once, then it is never redifined. Enough for reaping the
      low hanging fruits.

   Note, the input is not required to be in SSA.

  `P "An autorun pass that conservatively removes dead code. The
  removed dead code is usually produced by a lifter, though it might
  be possible that a binary indeed contains a dead code. The algorithm
  doesn't remove variables that are stored in memory, only registers
  are considered";

  `S "ALGORITHM";

  `P "To make analysis inter procedural, we first compute an
  over-approximation of a set of variables that are used to pass data
  between functions. This is just a set of all free variables in all
  functions. Variables that belong to this set will never be
  removed. Thus if a function $(b,f) uses a variable $(b,x), then we
  consider, that any other function may somehow call this function
  $(b,f), so we assume that it is used implicitly. External functions
  must obey the ABI, thus a set of all variables used to pass
  arguments to external functions is also added to the protected
  set. Once the protected set is computed, we compute def/use sets for
  each subroutine and remove all definitions that are not
  used. Internally, we translate a program into the SSA form, though
  it will not be seen outside";

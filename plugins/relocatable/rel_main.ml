     The default brancher is unable to infer the destination, as it
     is not encoded in a program itself, but in meta data of a file.
     The relocatable brancher will use OGRE to query for relocations
     and provide correct direct references to static code. For the
     external code references it will ouput a reference to the NULL
     address (along with the fallthrough address)";

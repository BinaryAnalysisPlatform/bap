(** [register ~scheme ~create] a service provider.
    Each time the resource with the specified [scheme] is going to be
    served the provided function will be called with two parameters:

    [query] a suggested query string, to distinguish the served
    resource from others. The [query] string is only a hint and it may
    even doesn't required to be unique, so that it is completely a
    server responsibility to provide a unique uri for the given data.
    Also ther query is not expected to be properly encoded.

    [file] a name of a local file that is mapped to
    [Bigsubstring.base]. The service provider may rely on the fact,
    that if the filename provided, then it is mapped.
